<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The study of the recent science of Comparative
Mythology is one of the most popular and attractive of minor scientific
pursuits. It deals with a subject-matter which has interested most of
us at one period of our lives, and turns the delight of our childhood
into a charm and recreation for maturer age. Nor is it without more
useful lessons. In it we see more clearly than perhaps elsewhere the
reciprocal influence, which none can wholly escape, of words and
language upon thought, and again of thought and fancy upon words and
language; how mere words and syllables may modify both conception and
belief; how the metaphor, which at first presented an object more
clearly and vividly to the mind than any more direct form of speech
could do, soon confuses and at last wholly distorts the original idea,
and buries its meaning under a new and foreign superstructure. We may
mark here, too, by numerous examples, how slowly the human mind rises
to the conception of any abstract truth, and how continually it falls
back upon the concrete fact which it is compelled to picture to itself
in order to state in words the simplest <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e800" href="#xd26e800" name="xd26e800">viii</a>]</span>mental
abstraction. The phrase, &ldquo;The dawn flies before the sun,&rdquo;
passing into the myth of Daphne and Apollo, is a lesson in psychology
no less than in philology and in comparative mythology.</p>
<p>Now, both the interest and the value of these studies are enhanced
in proportion as they become complete. Our conclusions approach nearer
to certainty, and will gradually pass from theory to demonstration, as
we find the same legends and modes of thought and expression on natural
phenomena constantly reappearing among the most distant and the most
isolated peoples, in languages which in their complex forms tell of the
infancy of human speech, and also in those whose worn-down frame speaks
of the world&rsquo;s old age.</p>
<p>Of the peoples now settled in Western Europe, the Basques are those
which are the most separate from other populations; distinct in
language, they represent, in a more or less mixed state, some older
stratum of European ethnology. Their language, too, as regards the mass
of the people, is still practically unwritten.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e806src" href="#xd26e806" name="xd26e806src">1</a> Here there is a
chance of finding legends in a purer and older form than among any
other European people; and in what they have borrowed from others, we
may have an almost unique crucial test of the time which it takes for
such traditions to pass orally from people of one language to another
and totally different one. None of these legends have been published or
even noticed till within the last two years, when M. d&rsquo;Abbadie
read the legend of the Tartaro before the <span lang=
"fr">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e811"
href="#xd26e811" name="xd26e811">ix</a>]</span>des Sciences et des Arts
de Bayonne</span>, and M. Cerquand his &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">L&eacute;gendes et R&eacute;cits Populaires du Pays
Basque</span>,&rdquo; before the sister society at Pau.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e817src" href="#xd26e817" name=
"xd26e817src">2</a></p>
<p>Of course we must expect to find such legends very much altered, and
in a state of almost inextricable confusion, and this not only through
forgetfulness, and through the lapse of time since their origin, not
only by the influence of a total change of religion, but they are also
mingled and inter-penetrated with totally new ideas; the old and the
new will be found side by side in striking and sometimes grotesque
contrast. As in Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tales of the West
Highlands,&rdquo; personages of mythical antiquity go to kirk, and
indulge in other decidedly post-Reformation practices, so in these
Basque tales the reader must not be startled by the introduction of
maize and tobacco, of cannon and gunpowder, of dances at the mairie,
and the use of the guillotine, in stories which, perhaps, originally
told of the movements of the stars, of the wars of the forces of the
atmosphere, of the bright beauty of the rising, or of the glowing glory
of the setting sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e822src" href="#xd26e822"
name="xd26e822src">3</a> The body is the same in all ages, but the
dress varies with the changing fashions. To borrow an illustration from
a slightly older science, this is not a simple case of contorted and
overlying strata to be restored to their original order, but rather of
strata worn down, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e828" href=
"#xd26e828" name="xd26e828">x</a>]</span>reconstructed, and deposited
anew, and even modified in their latest stage by the interference of
human action. And thus our problem becomes an exceedingly complex and
difficult one, and our readers must not be disappointed if our
conclusions are not so clear and positive as might be wished. The
present is merely a tentative, and not, in any sense, a final essay
towards its solution.</p>
<p>How are these legends told now, and how have they been preserved?
They are told by the Basque peasants, either when neighbours
meet&mdash;after the fashion made familiar to us by American novelists
in the &ldquo;Husking Bee&rdquo;&mdash;for the purpose of stripping the
husks from the ears of maize, an operation generally performed in one
or two long sessions; or at the prolonged wedding and other feasts, of
which we have evidence in the tales themselves, or else in the long
nights round the wintry hearth of their lonely dwellings. For it is one
of the charms of the Basque land that the houses are scattered all over
the face of the country, instead of being collected into crowded
villages; and it is, perhaps, to this fact chiefly that we owe the
preservation of so much old-world lore, and of primitive ideas, among
this people. The reader must not be surprised at the length of some of
our specimens. The details of the incidents of the longest are
religiously preserved and, as told at home, they are probably more
lengthy (as anyone will understand who has ever taken anything down
from recitation) than as here given. Many an unlettered Basque peasant
could serve an irritable stranger as Glendower did Hotspur, when he
kept him &ldquo;at least nine hours <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e832" href="#xd26e832" name="xd26e832">xi</a>]</span>in reckoning
up the several devils&rsquo; names that were his lackeys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In La Soule the &ldquo;Pastorales,&rdquo; or Basque dramas, which
last from six to eight hours of uninterrupted action, are learnt in the
same way by word of mouth during the long evenings of winter.</p>
<p>These legends are still most thoroughly believed in. They still form
part of the faith of these simple people&mdash;not at all, we need
hardly say, in the use of mythological or atmospheric allegory, but as
narratives of veritable fact. They believe them as they do the
histories of the Bible or the &ldquo;Lives of the Saints.&rdquo; In
fact, the problem of reconciling religion and science presents itself
to their minds in this strange guise&mdash;how to reconcile these
narratives with those of the Bible and of the Church. The general
solution is that they happened before the time of which the Bible
speaks, or before Adam fell. They are &ldquo;<span lang="eu">Lege
zaharreko istorriguak</span>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;histories of the
ancient law&rdquo;&mdash;by which is apparently meant the time before
Christianity. &ldquo;This happened, sir, in the time when all animals
and all things could speak,&rdquo; was said again and again by our
narrators at the commencement of their story; not one doubted the
literal truth of what they told. Their na&iuml;ve good faith
occasionally severely tested our own gravity. Appeal was often made to
our supposed superior knowledge to confirm the facts. The varying tone
of the voice told how truly the speakers sympathised with what they
uttered. At times sobs almost interrupted utterance, when the frequent
apostrophe came: &ldquo;Think how this poor so-and-so must have
suffered!&rdquo; More often bursts <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e841" href="#xd26e841" name="xd26e841">xii</a>]</span>of laughter
at traditional jokes, too poor to raise a smile on less unsophisticated
lips, broke the recital. Very determined, too, is their adherence to
what they believe to be the genuine text of these old tales. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand it, but the history says so;&rdquo; &ldquo;It is
<i>so</i>;<span class="corr" id="xd26e846" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> &ldquo;The story says so,&rdquo; was
positively affirmed again and again&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, in one of the
Peau d&rsquo;Ane or Cinderella stories, when the lady has dazzled her
admirer by her dress of silver (moonlight?), then of gold (sunlight?),
then of diamonds (dew-drops?), at last, on the wedding-day, the bride
and bridegroom <i>dress each other</i>. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
why,&rdquo; interrupted the story-teller, &ldquo;but the story says
so.&rdquo; Could anything tell more quaintly of the marriage of the sun
and dawn? The sun decking the morning clouds with his light and beauty,
and they again robing him in their soft and tender colouring.</p>
<p>But we must pass on to the tales themselves. None of these, we
think, will be found to be genuinely or exclusively Basque; the oldest
we take to be those most widely known, and which are most distorted.
The heads under which we have arranged them are: (1) Legends of the
Tartaro, or Cyclops; (2) of the Heren-Suge, the Seven-Headed Serpent;
(3) of purely Animal Tales, which are neither fables nor allegories;
(4) of Basa-Jauna, Basa-Andre, and of the Lami&ntilde;ak, or Fairies;
(5) Tales of Witchcraft; (6) those which, for want of a better name, we
have entitled Contes des F&eacute;es, in which the fairy is an Eastern
magician&mdash;these we have divided into sections, (<i>a</i>) those
which resemble the Keltic and other tales, and (<i>b</i>) those which
are probably borrowed directly from the French; our last division (7),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e864" href="#xd26e864" name=
"xd26e864">xiii</a>]</span>Religious Tales and Legends, are probably
from medi&aelig;val sources common to Latin Christianity, but they are
interesting as specimens of the tales which probably delighted the
highest born of our own ancestors in the middle ages, and now linger
only among the peasantry in out-of-the-way corners of Europe. Some of
these tales seem to us to be more gracefully told, and have more of
human interest in them, than any of the others.</p>
<p>We fear scientific men will be disappointed in this collection.
Notwithstanding that we have been careful to collect from those who
know the Basque only, or who certainly knew only Basque when they first
learnt these tales, yet they are evidently much mixed with French and
Spanish. Our translations are literal to baldness; the only liberty we
have taken is in softening down the exceeding directness and grossness
of some portions. Not one tale is in the least licentious&mdash;but the
Basque language calls a spade a spade, and not an implement of
husbandry.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e868src" href="#xd26e868" name=
"xd26e868src">4</a> The Carlist war of the last four years has
prevented our getting any legends from the Spanish Basque provinces,
and has even to some extent hindered our work in the French Pays
Basque, by providing an almost exclusive object of interest. In the
more remote districts of the Pays Basque itself, which we have not been
able to revisit since we commenced this collection, purer forms of some
of these legends may be found, and others of which we have no
example;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e873src" href="#xd26e873" name=
"xd26e873src">5</a> but these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e884"
href="#xd26e884" name="xd26e884">xiv</a>]</span>which we give are
really representative. Though collected mainly in the neighbourhood of
St. Jean de Luz, we have tested them by enquiry of natives of all the
provinces, and find that they are equally well known in La Soule and in
Basse Navarre as in the Labourd. We never met with a Basque peasant who
could not tell us what are the Tartaro, the Heren-Suge, Basa-Jaun, and
the Lami&ntilde;ak.</p>
<p>As a curious coincidence, we may notice how closely some of the
Basque names of the stars parallel those given in Miss Frere&rsquo;s
delightful &ldquo;Old Deccan Days.&rdquo; In the narrator&rsquo;s
narrative, pp. 27, 28, we read, &ldquo;She (the grandmother) would show
us the hen and chickens&rdquo; (the Pleiades)&mdash;the same in Basque,
&ldquo;<span lang="eu">Oiloa chituekin</span>;&rdquo; &ldquo;The three
thieves climbing up to rob the Ranee&rsquo;s silver
bedstead&rdquo;&mdash;the three stars in Orion&rsquo;s belt, in Basque,
the three kings, or brothers, or <i>robbers</i>; the milky way,
&ldquo;the great pathway of light on which He went up to heaven,&rdquo;
has also obtained in Basque a Christianized
name&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="eu">Erromako zubia</span>, or
Bidea,&rdquo; &ldquo;the bridge or road to Rome.&rdquo; Again,
&ldquo;All the cobras in my grandmother&rsquo;s stories were
seven-headed,&rdquo; so the Heren-Suge in the Basque country is always
seven-headed. Little or nothing can be gathered from the names of the
actors, the heroes or heroines of these tales. They are mostly
anonymous, but the name, when given, is almost always borrowed from the
French. This is disappointing, and much increases the difficulty of
tracing the origin; but it is analogous to the fact that scarcely a
single purely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e897" href="#xd26e897"
name="xd26e897">xv</a>]</span>Basque name is to be found among the
so-called kings and chieftains of the Basques during the early middle
ages.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e899src" href="#xd26e899" name=
"xd26e899src">6</a> Among the classic writers, too, and among the
soldiers and followers of our Anglo-Gascon princes, hardly a name
indubitably Basque is to be found.</p>
<p>For all more special details and discussions we refer to the
Introductions to the separate sections. The few references given to the
parallel legends of other countries are not intended to be at all
complete, much less exhaustive. The Pays Basque is not a land of
libraries, and it is not easy to collect these legends on the spot, and
at the same time to get together the books necessary for a comparison
of them with those of other countries. The few we offer are only those
which have fallen in our way, and though worthless to the specialist,
may be of some little aid as suggestions to the ordinary
reader.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e910src" href="#xd26e910" name=
"xd26e910src">7</a> For the same purpose we annex a list of the first
publication of the chief collections of foreign legends in
France.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e916src" href="#xd26e916" name=
"xd26e916src">8</a> It is curious to remark that, while the
masterpieces of French literature seem never to have penetrated beyond
the surface of society, these legends have pierced to the very bottom
of the social mass, and have become real living household words, even
to those many millions of Frenchmen who do not understand one word of
French.</p>
<p>There remains the pleasant task of thanking some of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e924" href="#xd26e924" name=
"xd26e924">xvi</a>]</span>the many friends who have assisted us in this
collection. I had hoped to have joined the name of M. J. Vinson, the
well-known Basque and Dravidian scholar, to my own as joint-author of
this simple work. I should hardly have had the courage to have
undertaken it had I not been assured of his invaluable assistance in
difficulties about the language of the originals. Unavoidable
circumstances have, however, prevented his seeing the Basque of many of
the later tales, and he therefore prefers that the &ldquo;Essay on the
Basque Language&rdquo; should alone bear his name. I cannot but accede
to his wishes; but, at the same time, I offer him my most grateful
thanks for the unfailing and unwearied help which he so kindly afforded
me for many months. The legends contributed by him are noticed in their
proper place. Our first acknowledgments are due to M. d&rsquo;Abbadie,
of Abbadia, the well-known &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Membre de
l&rsquo;Institut</span>,&rdquo; for his kind assistance and ready
communication of the legends in his possession, and which were the
starting point of our work. Next, and even more, to Madame M. Bellevue,
of Dajieu-baita, through whose kind intervention the majority of these
tales were collected, and who assisted in the translation of almost
all. And then to the sisters Estefanella and Gagna-haurra Hirigaray,
who contributed more than twenty tales; to Dr. Guilbeau and other
friends at St. Jean de Luz who have taken a friendly interest in our
work, and to all those whose names are appended to the tales they
furnished. It would be presumptuous to hope that our readers will find
as much pleasure in perusing these tales as we have had in collecting
them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb1" href="#pb1" name=

<h2 class="main">I.&mdash;Legends of the Tartaro.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Who, or what is the Tartaro? &ldquo;Oh! you mean the
man with one eye in the middle of his forehead,&rdquo; is the prompt
and universal answer. The Tartaro is the Cyclops, the sun&rsquo;s round
eye, <span class="trans" title="kykl&#333;ps"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&kappa;&#8059;&kappa;&lambda;&omega;&psi;</span></span>. But the
word Tartaro has apparently nothing to do with this. M. Cerquand, in
his &ldquo;Legendes et R&eacute;cits Populaires du Pays Basque,&rdquo;
derives the word from <i>Tartare</i>, Tartar, in the same way as the
French word <i>Ogre</i> is said to be derived from <i>Hongrois</i>,
<i>Ugri</i>. The only objection to this highly probable derivation
(made still more probable by a Souletin variation, Moiriak) is the
comparatively late date (the 13th century) of the first appearance of
the Tartars in Europe.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e958src" href=
"#xd26e958" name="xd26e958src">1</a> It is besides perfectly true that
in many tales the Tartaro replaces, and is identical with the giant or
ogre; but this does not appear to us to be the original conception of
this mythological monster, nor have we ever heard from an unlettered
Basque such a description of him. To them he is simply a
Cyclops&mdash;a huge man, with an eye in the centre of his
forehead.</p>
<p>It is an interesting question&mdash;Is there any connection between
the Basque Tartaro and the Cyclops of the Odyssey and of the classics?
First, we must remark that the Cyclops legend is not peculiar either to
the Greek <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>and Latin writers, or even to the Aryan nations;
<i>e.g.</i>, in his communication of the Tartaro legends to the
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Sciences de Bayonne, M. d&rsquo;Abaddie
relates how he heard the tale told in June, 1843, in Eastern Africa, in
Lat. N. 9.2, E. Lon. 34.48, by a man who had never before quitted the
country. It is then only the special form of the legend, and not the
primary idea, that the Greeks <i>may</i> have borrowed from the
Basques. But there is this to observe&mdash;that, with both Greeks and
Latins, the Cyclops myth is an occidental and not an oriental one, and
is more strictly localised than almost any other. This may be accounted
for by saying that the sun&rsquo;s great fiery eye is rather that of
the setting than of the rising sun; that the red-hot stake is the ruddy
mountain peak, or the tall fir-trunk, seen against the western horizon,
and illumined by his descending rays. But in the stories of Theocritus
and Ovid, where the sun-myth is not so apparent, the home of the
Cyclops is still Sicily. Our first Tartaro legend reads very like a
rough outline of Ovid&rsquo;s story of &ldquo;Acis and Galatea.&rdquo;
Now, W. Von Humboldt in his &ldquo;<span lang="de">Pr&uuml;fung der
Untersuchung &uuml;ber die Urbewohner Hispaniens vermittelst der
Vaskischen Sprache</span>&rdquo; (Berlin, 1821), in cap. xlv., p. 167,
and, again, con. vii., p. 178, arguing on quite different grounds,
places Sicily as the most easterly habitation of the Basques within
historic times.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e993src" href="#xd26e993"
name="xd26e993src">2</a> We leave it then to classical scholars to
consider whether the Italic races in <span lang="la">Magna
Gr&aelig;cia</span> and Sicily may not have come in contact with the
Basques there, and from them have adopted their special form of the
Cyclops legend.</p>
<p>As we said above, the Tartaro sometimes replaces the giant or the
ogre; at other times we find him as Basa-Jaun, or even as an animal,
substituted for <i>Acheria</i>, the fox. He is, in his proper form, a
huge one-eyed giant, occasionally a cannibal, but not without a rough
&ldquo;bonhomie&rdquo; when satiated with food and drink.
Intellectually far below the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href=
"#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>feebler race of mankind, he is
invariably beaten in his contests with them, notwithstanding his
enormous strength; he loses all his wagers, and is generally lured on
to commit involuntary suicide. In some aspects he reminds one of
Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lubbar Fiend,&rdquo; and in his constant defeats
and being constantly outwitted, recals one of the types of the Devil in
medi&aelig;val story. At times he appears in gentler guise, as when he
aids the young prince to his rights, and supplies Petit Yorge with the
means of victory over the Heren-Suge. What the talking ring is which
appears in so many of these stories we confess ourselves unable to
interpret; it is found in the Keltic, but, as far as we are aware, not
in the classic legends.</p>
<p>One peculiarity of the Basque, and especially of the Tartaro
legends, is that the hero of them is so often a madman, an idiot, or a
fool. If we can trust our memory, the case is the same in the Slavonic
representatives of Odysseus.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1014src" href=
"#xd26e1014" name="xd26e1014src">3</a> But the Basques seem to dwell
upon and to repeat the idea in a peculiar way; they ring the changes on
all states, from the wild madman, like the Scandinavian Berserker,
through the idiot and fool, to the mere blockhead and ninny. Errua,
Enuchenta, Ergela, Sosua, Tontua, are terms employed to designate the
heroes who have sometimes, to our modern apprehension, little of the
idiot or fool, except the name. Can it be that the power which put out
the sun&rsquo;s fiery eye was looked upon as a beneficent being in a
burning tropic land, while, as the legend travelled northward, the act
seemed more like that of madness, or of senseless stupidity?</p>
<p>One type of these Tartaro tales will at once recal Grimm&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Valiant Little Tailor,&rdquo; and some of the more modern
versions of &ldquo;Jack the Giant-Killer.&rdquo; But though the
incidents are identical, it is hardly possible that they can be thus
borrowed. Several of our narrators were <i>utterly</i> ignorant of
French, and learnt the tale as children from old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>people, who
died a few years since at upwards of 80. The first translation of
Grimm&rsquo;s Tales into French was published in the year 1845.</p>

again only by marrying. One day he met a young girl who refused him,
because she was so frightened at him. And the Tartaro wanted to give
her a ring, which she would not accept. However, he sent it her by a
young man. As soon as the ring was upon her finger it began to say,
&ldquo;Thou there, and I here.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">M. d&rsquo;Abbadie&rsquo;s Version.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Our next story was communicated by M. d&rsquo;Abbadie
to the <span lang="fr">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Sciences et des Arts
de Bayonne</span>. The narrator is M. l&rsquo;Abb&eacute; Heguiagaray,
the Parish Priest of Esquiule in La Soule:&mdash;</p>
<p>In my infancy I often heard from my mother the story of the Tartaro.
He was a Colossus, with only one eye in the middle of his forehead. He
was a shepherd and a hunter, but a hunter of men. Every day he ate a
sheep; then, after a snooze, every one who had the misfortune to fall
into his hands. His dwelling was a huge barn, with thick walls, a high
roof, and a very strong door, which he alone knew how <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>to open. His
mother, an old witch, lived in one corner of the garden, in a hut
constructed of turf.</p>
<p>One day a powerful young man was caught in the snares of the
Tartaro, who carried him off to his house. This young man saw the
Tartaro eat a whole sheep, and he knew that he was accustomed to take a
snooze, and that after that his own turn would come. In his despair he
said to himself that he must do something. Directly the Tartaro began
to snore he put the spit into the fire, made it red-hot, and plunged it
into the giant&rsquo;s one eye. Immediately he leapt up, and began to
run after the man who had injured him; but it was impossible to find
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not escape. It is all very well to hide
yourself,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I alone know the secret how to
open this door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tartaro opened the door half-way, and let the sheep out between
his legs. The young man takes the big bell off the ram, and puts it
round his neck, and throws over his body the skin of the sheep which
the giant had just eaten, and walks on all fours to the door.</p>
<p>The Tartaro examines him by feeling him, perceives the trick, and
clutches hold of the skin; but the young man slips off the skin, dives
between his legs, and runs off.</p>
<p>Immediately the mother of the Tartaro meets him, and says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you lucky young fellow! You have escaped the cruel tyrant;
take this ring as a remembrance of your escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accepts, puts the ring on his finger, and immediately the ring
begins to cry out, &ldquo;Heben nuk! Heben nuk!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Thou
hast me here! Thou hast me here!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The Tartaro pursues, and is on the point of catching him, when the
young man, maddened with fright, and not being able to pull off the
ring, takes out his knife, and cuts off his own finger, and throws it
away, and thus escapes the pursuit of the Tartaro.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p id="ch1.3">In other versions the young man goes into the forest with
some pigs, meets the Tartaro there, is carried by him home,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>blinds him with the red-hot spit, and escapes by
letting himself down through a garret window. The Tartaro pursues,
guided by his ring, which at last he throws to the young man to put on,
when it cries out as above, and the young man cuts off his finger, and
throws it down a precipice or into a bog, where the ring still cries
out, and the Tartaro following, is dashed to pieces and drowned.</p>

<h3 class="main">Errua, the Madman.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a man and
woman who had a son. He was very wicked, and did nothing but mischief,
and was of a thoroughly depraved disposition. The parents decided that
they must send him away, and the lad was quite willing to set off.</p>
<p>He set out then, and goes far, far, far away. He comes to a city,
and asks if they want a servant. They wanted one in a (certain) house.
He goes there. They settle their terms at so much a month, and that the
one who is not satisfied should strip the skin off the other&rsquo;s
back.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1085src" href="#xd26e1085" name=
"xd26e1085src">5</a></p>
<p>The master sends his servant to the forest to get the most crooked
pieces of wood that he can find. Near the forest there was a vineyard.
What does the servant do but cut it all up, and carries it to the
house. The master asks him where the wood is. He shows him the
vine-wood cut up. The master said nothing to him, but he was not
pleased.</p>
<p>Next day the master says to him, &ldquo;Take the cows to such a
field, and don&rsquo;t break any hole in the fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What does the lad do? He cuts all the cows into little pieces, and
throws them bit by bit into the field. The master was still more angry;
but he could not say anything, for fear of having his skin stripped
off. So what does he do? He buys a herd of pigs, and sends his servant
to the mountain with the herd. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href=
"#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>The master knew quite well that there was a Tartaro in this
mountain, but he sends him there all the same.</p>
<p>Our madman goes walking on, on, on. He arrives at a little hut. The
Tartaro&rsquo;s house was quite close to his. The pigs of the Tartaro
and those of the madman used to go out together. The Tartaro said one
day to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you make a wager as to who will throw a stone
farthest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accepted the wager. That evening our madman was very sad. While
he was at his prayers, an old woman appeared to him, and asks
him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you? Why are you so sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells her the wager that he has made with the Tartaro. The old
woman says to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is only that, it is nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so she gives him a bird, and says to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of a stone, throw this bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The madman was very glad at this. The next day he does as the old
woman told him. The Tartaro&rsquo;s stone went enormously far, but at
last it fell; but the madman&rsquo;s bird never came down at all.</p>
<p>The Tartaro was astonished that he had lost his wager, and they make
another&mdash;which of the two should throw a bar of iron the farthest.
The madman accepted again. He was in his little house sadly in prayer.
The old woman appears again. She asks him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made a wager again, which of the two will throw the
bar of iron the farthest, and I am very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is only that, it is nothing. When you take hold of the
bar of iron, say, &lsquo;Rise up, bar of iron, here and
Salamanca.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; (<span lang="eu">Altchaala palenka,
hemen eta Salamanka.</span>)<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1129src" href=
"#xd26e1129" name="xd26e1129src">6</a></p>
<p>Next day the Tartaro takes his terrible bar of iron, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>throws it fearfully far. The young man could hardly
lift up one end, and he says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise up, bar of iron, here and Salamanca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Tartaro heard that (he cried out)&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give up the wager&mdash;you have won,&rdquo; and he takes
the bar of iron away from him. &ldquo;My father and my mother live at
Salamanca; don&rsquo;t throw, I beg of you, I implore you&mdash;you
will crush them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our madman goes away very happy.</p>
<p>The Tartaro says to him again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pull up the biggest oak in the forest, and you pull up
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And the later it grew in the day, the
sadder he became. He was at his prayers. The old woman comes to him
again, and says to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells her the wager he has made with the Tartaro, and how he will
pull up an oak. The old woman gives him three balls of thread, and
tells him to begin and tie them to all the oaks in the forest.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1155src" href="#xd26e1155" name=
"xd26e1155src">7</a></p>
<p>Next day the Tartaro pulls up his oak, an enormously, enormously big
one; and the madman begins to tie, and to tie, and to tie.</p>
<p>The Tartaro asks him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You (pulled up) one, but I all these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tartaro replies,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! No! What shall I do to fatten my pigs with without
acorns? You have won; you have won the wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tartaro did not know what to think about it, and saw that he had
found one cleverer than himself, and so he asks him if he will come and
spend the night at his house.</p>
<p>The madman says, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes to bed then with the Tartaro. But he knew that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>there was a
dead man under the bed. When the Tartaro was asleep what does the
madman do? He places the dead man by the Tartaro&rsquo;s side, and gets
under the bed himself. In the middle of the night the Tartaro gets up,
and takes his terrible bar of iron and showers blows upon blows, ping
pan, ping pan, as long and as hard as he could give them.</p>
<p>The Tartaro gets up as usual, and goes to see his pigs, and the
madman also comes out from under the bed; and he goes to see the pigs
too. The Tartaro is quite astounded to see him coming, and does not
know what to think of it. He says to himself that he has to do with a
cleverer than he; but he asks him if he has slept well.</p>
<p>He answers, &ldquo;Yes, very well; only I felt a few
flea-bites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their pigs had got mixed, and as they were fat, he had to separate
them in order to go away with his. The Tartaro asked the madman what
mark his pigs had.</p>
<p>The madman says to him, &ldquo;Mine have some of them one mark, some
of them two marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set to work to look at them, and they all had these same
marks.</p>
<p>Our madman goes off then with all the hogs. He goes walking on, on,
on, with all his pigs. He comes to a town where it was just market day,
and sells them all except two, keeping, however, all the tails, which
he put in his pockets. As you may think, he was always in fear of the
Tartaro. He sees him coming down from the mountain. He kills one of his
hogs, and puts the entrails in his own bosom under his waistcoat. There
was a group of men near the road. As he passed them he took out his
knife, and stabs it into his chest, and takes out the pig&rsquo;s
bowels, and our madman begins to run very much faster than before, with
his pig in front of him.</p>
<p>When the Tartaro comes up to these men, he asks if they have seen
such a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, he was running fast, and in order to go faster just
here he stabbed himself, and threw away his bowels, and still he went
on all the faster.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Tartaro, too, in order to go faster, thrusts his knife into his
body, and falls stark dead.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1202src" href=
"#xd26e1202" name="xd26e1202src">8</a></p>
<p>The madman goes to his master&rsquo;s. Near the house there was a
marsh quite full of mud. He puts his live pig into it, and all the
tails too. He enters the house, and says to the master that he is there
with his pigs. The master is astounded to see him.</p>
<p>He asks him, &ldquo;Where are the pigs, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to him, &ldquo;They have gone into the mud, they were so
tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both go out, and begin to get the real pig out, and between the two
they pull it out very well. They try to do the same thing with the
others; but they kept pulling out nothing but tails.</p>
<p>The madman says, &ldquo;You see how fat they are; that is why the
tails come out alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sends the servant to fetch the spade and the hoe. Instead of
bringing them he begins to beat the mistress, whack! whack! and he
cries to the master, &ldquo;One or both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The master says to him, &ldquo;Both, both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he beats the servant maid almost to pieces. He goes then to
the master, taking with him the spade and the hoe, and he sets to
beating him with the spade and the hoe, until he can no longer defend
himself, and then he thrashes the skin off his back, and takes his pig
and goes off home to his father and mother; and as he lived well he
died well too.</p>

<p class="first">We have several variations of this tale, some like the
above, very similar to Grimm&rsquo;s &ldquo;Valiant Little
Tailor,&rdquo; others like Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Highland

fool (Enuchenta eta Ergela). The idiot goes out to service first, and
gets sent back for his stupidity. Then the fool goes, and outwits both
his master and the Tartaro, whose eye he burns out with a red-hot spit,
as in the first instance. In another the servant frightens the Tartaro
at the outset by cracking two walnuts, and saying that they were bones
of Christians he was cracking. Another wager is as to which shall carry
most water from a fountain. The Tartaro fills two hogsheads to carry,
but the lad says to him, &ldquo;Only that; I will take the whole
fountain;&rdquo; and he begins to stir the water about with a stick.
But the Tartaro cries out, &ldquo;No! No! No! I give up. Where shall I
go and drink if you carry away all my water?&rdquo; Another variation
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Three Brothers, the Cruel Master, and the
Tartaro.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there lived a mother
with her three sons. They were not rich, but lived by their work. The
eldest son said one day to his mother&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be better for us if I should go out to
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother did not like it, but at last she let him go. He goes off,
far, far, far away, and comes to a house, and asks if they want a
servant. They say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and they make their agreement.</p>
<p>The master was to give a very high salary&mdash;100,000
francs&mdash;but the servant was to do everything that the master
ordered him, and, if he did not do it, the master was to tear the skin
off his back at the end of the year, and to dismiss him without
pay.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1246src" href="#xd26e1246" name=
"xd26e1246src">9</a></p>
<p>The servant said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I am strong, and I will work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morrow the master gives him a great deal of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>work,
but he does it easily. The last months of the year the master presses
him much more, and one day he sends him into a field to sow fourteen
bushels of wheat in the day. The lad goes sadly, taking with him a pair
of oxen. He returns to the house very late in the evening. The master
says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you done your work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the agreement we made? I must tear the skin
off your back: that is your salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tears the skin off, as he had said, and sends him away home
without anything. His mother was in great grief at seeing him come home
so thin and weak, and without any money.</p>
<p>He tells what has happened, and the second brother wishes to start
off at once, saying that he is strong, and that he will do more work.
The mother did not like it, but she was obliged to let him go.</p>
<p>He goes to the same house as his brother, and makes the same terms
with the master. When he had almost finished his year, his master sends
him too to sow fourteen bushels of wheat. He starts very early in the
morning, with two pair of oxen; but the night came before he had sown
it all. The master was very glad at the sight of that. He strips his
skin off his back also, and sends him away without any money. Think of
the vexation of this mother in seeing both her sons return in this
fashion.</p>
<p>The third wishes to start off at once. He assures his mother that he
will bring back both the money and the skin of his back. He goes to
this same gentleman. He tells this one, too, that he will give him a
high salary, on condition that he will do all that he shall tell him to
do, otherwise he shall have the skin torn off his back, and be sent
away without anything, at the end of the year.</p>
<p>He had made him work hard and well for ten months, and then wished
to try him. He sent him to the field, and told him to sow fourteen
bushels of wheat before night. He answers, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>He takes two pairs of oxen, and goes off to the field. He ploughs a
furrow all round the field, and throws his fourteen bushels of wheat
into it. He then makes another furrow, to cover it up, and at night
time he goes home to the house. The master is astonished. He asks him
if he has sown it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is all under ground; you may be sure of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The master was not pleased; he had his fears.</p>
<p>The next day he sends him with sixteen head of cattle to such a
field, and says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take all these cattle into the field without
unlocking the gate or making a gap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our lad takes a hatchet, a hoe, and a fork. Off he goes, and when he
gets to the field he kills them all, one by one. He cuts them up with
the hatchet, and throws them with the fork into the field.</p>
<p>He comes home at nightfall, and says to his master that all the
cattle are in the field as he had told him. The master was not pleased,
but he said nothing.</p>
<p>The next day he told him to go to such a forest and to bring a load
of wood from there, but all the sticks quite, quite straight. Our lad
goes off and cuts down in the chestnut copse all the young chestnut
trees which his master had planted, and which were very fine ones; and
he comes home. When the master saw that, he was not pleased, and said
to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow you shall go again with the oxen; and you must
bring a load of wood quite crooked, all quite crooked; if you bring
only one straight, so much the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad goes off, and pulls up a fine vineyard. After he had loaded
his cart, he comes home. When the master saw that, he could not say
anything; but he did not know what to think of it.</p>
<p>He sends him into a forest. There was a Tartaro there; and all the
persons, and all the animals who went there, he ate them all. The
master gives him ten pigs, and also food for ten days, telling him that
the hogs would fatten themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>well there, because there were
plenty of acorns, and that he must return at the end of ten days.</p>
<p>Our lad begins, and he goes on, and on, and on. He meets an old
woman, who says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To such a forest, to fatten these pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are not a fool, you will not go there. That horrible
Tartaro will eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This woman was carrying a basket of walnuts on her head, and he said
to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give me two of these walnuts I will beat the
Tartaro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She willingly gives them to him, and he goes on, and on, and on. He
meets another old woman, who was winding thread. She says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To such a forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go there. There is a horrible Tartaro there, who
will be sure to eat you, and your pigs as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go there all the same, and I will conquer him, if you
will give me two of your balls of thread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gives him them, willingly; and he goes on farther, and finds a
blacksmith, and he, too, asks him where he is going? And he answers,
&ldquo;To such a forest, to fatten my pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may just as well go back again. There is a terrible
Tartaro there, who will be sure to eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give me a spit, I will beat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give it you, willingly,&rdquo; and he gives it him
with goodwill.</p>
<p>Our lad goes on, and comes to this forest. He cuts off the tails of
all his pigs, and hides them in a safe place. The Tartaro appears, and
says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come here? I am going to eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat a pig if you like, but don&rsquo;t touch me.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>He takes his two nuts, and rubs them one against the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two balls here, and if one of them touches you, you
are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tartaro is frightened, and goes away in silence. After having
eaten a pig, he comes back again, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make a wager&mdash;which of the two will make the
greatest heap of wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tartaro begins to cut and to cut. Our lad leaves him alone, and
when he has made a terrible big heap, he begins to go round all the
trees with his balls of thread, and says to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, that; but I, all this;&rdquo; and he goes on tying and
tying. The Tartaro gives in, saying &ldquo;that he is more clever than
he.&rdquo; As he had stopped his ten days, he makes in the night a
great fire, and makes his spit red-hot in it; and while the Tartaro was
sleeping, he plunges this spit into his only eye. After having taken
his pigs&rsquo; tails, he goes away from the forest without any pigs,
because the Tartaro had eaten one every day. Near his master&rsquo;s
house there was &ldquo;a well of the fairy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1358src" href="#xd26e1358" name="xd26e1358src">10</a> Our lad
sticks in there the tails of all his hogs, excepting one, as well as he
could. He then goes running to his master, telling him that all the
pigs were coming home very gaily, and that they had got so hot in
coming so fast that they had all gone under the mud. &ldquo;I wished to
drag one out by pulling, but only the tail came away; here it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes off then with the master to this marsh; but the master did
not dare go in there to pull them out. He goes off sadly with his
servant home, not knowing what to think about it. There he counts him
out his 100,000 francs, and he went home proudly to his mother and his
brothers. There they lived happily, and their master was left with
100,000 francs less. That served him right for having so much.

<h3 class="main">The Tartaro and Petit Perroquet.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a mother and
her son. They were very wretched. One day the son said to his mother
that he must go away, to see if he could do anything. He goes far, far,
far away. He traverses many countries, and still goes on and on. He
arrives in a great city, and asks if they know of a place for a
servant. They tell him that there is one in the king&rsquo;s house.
There they tell him that he is to be gardener. But he tells them that
he does not know how to use a hoe at all, but that, all the same, he
would learn it with the others. He was very nice-looking. He soon
learnt it, and was liked by everybody.</p>
<p>This king had a daughter, and she often noticed Petit Perroquet,
because he was polite to everybody. In this city there was a prince,
and he was paying court to this young princess, and he was seized with
dislike and jealousy of Petit Perroquet. One day this prince<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1376src" href="#xd26e1376" name=
"xd26e1376src">11</a> went to find the king. He said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know what Petit Perroquet says?&mdash;that he
could bring the Tartaro&rsquo;s horse here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king sends for Petit Perroquet, and says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that you have said that you could bring the
Tartaro&rsquo;s horse here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did not say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you said
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give me all that I ask for, I will
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asks for a great deal of money, and sets off. He travels on, and
on, and on, and he had to pass a wide river. He speaks to the ferryman,
and pays the passage money, and tells him that perhaps he will have a
heavy load on his return, but that he will be well paid. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>He lands on the other side; but he had yet a long way to go in the
forest, because the Tartaro lived in a corner of the mountain. At last
he arrives, and knocks at the door. An old, old woman comes to him, and
says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off from here as quickly as possible; my son smells the
smell of a Christian a league off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To eat me here, or to eat me elsewhere, it is all the same to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he goes outside, and hides himself under a great heap of cut
ferns. He had scarcely been there a moment, when he hears a deep
breathing and a grinding of teeth, which sounded like thunder. He stops
where he is, trembling. The Tartaro goes to his house, and asks his
mother if there is not some Christian or other hidden here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;But eat away, your dinner is
all ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! I must eat this Christian first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes hunting, looking, looking into every corner. He goes to the
heap of ferns, and pulls off some to put them on one side; but our
Petit Perroquet was quite, quite at the bottom. The Tartaro was just on
the point of finding him, but he grew tired, and went indoors, and
began to eat and to drink enormously. Our Petit Perroquet creeps out of
his ferns, and goes off to the stable. The horse had a big bell round
his neck, but he fills it with ferns (this bell was as large as the big
bell in the church of St. Jean de Luz). He mounts on the horse&rsquo;s
back, and very soon he arrives at the ferry, and the ferryman comes to
meet him. Together they get the horse into the ferry-boat as well as
they could, and they cross over. He gave him a handsome reward. As soon
as he was on the other side, the Tartaro appeared, crying out to him to
give him his horse back again, and that he would give him all he could
wish for. He replies, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and goes off full gallop. When
he came near the king&rsquo;s palace he took the fern out of the bell,
and everybody comes running out of doors or to the windows. All the
world was astonished to see Petit Perroquet return.</p>
<p>The king was in ecstasy. He did not know what to say, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>but he
liked him even more than he did formerly, and the princess did also.
The other prince was not at all pleased, and he begins to think of some
other plot. He goes off to find the king, and he says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know that Petit Perroquet says that he could bring
the Tartaro&rsquo;s diamond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king sends for Petit Perroquet, and says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that you say you can get the Tartaro&rsquo;s
diamond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did not say any such thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;you said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! I did not say it; but I will try, if you give me all
I shall ask for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he asks for a great deal of money.</p>
<p>He goes off, and reaches the ferry, and pays the ferryman well, and
goes far, far, far away into the forest, till he gets to the house of
the Tartaro. The old woman tells him to be off from there; and he goes
and hides himself again in the ferns. And he stops there until the
Tartaro comes to the house, just as he did the first time. He turns
over nearly all the ferns, and leaves him scarcely covered. He stops
quietly there all the time that the Tartaro was having his huge supper,
and when he thinks he has finished, and is taking his nap, he creeps
out very, very gently. The Tartaro always put his diamond under his
pillow, and he takes it away without waking him, and escapes, running
off as fast as if to break his feet. The ferryman is there, and he
crosses him over, and he pays him well. The Tartaro appears on the
other side again, and calls out to him telling him to give him back his
diamond, and that he would give him all that he could wish for. He
answers, &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; and runs on to the king&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>When he arrived there, the king did not know what to do. One feasted
him, and another feasted him, and all the world was busied about him,
and everyone loved him more and more, and the princess as well as the
rest. The wicked prince did not know what to think of it. He was eaten
up with jealousy, and he thought of something else, and said to the
king: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Petit Perroquet says that he can bring the Tartaro
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king sends for Petit Perroquet, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears that you have said that you will bring the Tartaro
himself here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, I did not say anything at all like that; but if
you will give me all I ask for, I will try. You must have a carriage
made of iron, half-a-yard thick, and three horses to draw it, and lots
of money. When all that is ready, I will set out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asks, also, for a barrel of honey, another of feathers, and two
horns, and starts off.</p>
<p>When he comes to the ferry, it was no easy thing to get this
carriage into the boat. When he has got to the other side, he first
puts himself into the barrel of honey, and then into the barrel of
feathers, and ties the horns on to his head, and then mounts as
postilion. He then comes to the Tartaro&rsquo;s house, and just then he
happened to be at home. Petit Perroquet knocks at the door. The Tartaro
himself comes to open, and asks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I!!&mdash;I am the oldest of all the devils in
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opens the carriage door for him, and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tartaro gets in, and Petit Perroquet, very glad, starts off, and
arrives at the ferry. He crosses, as he best can, with his carriage and
horses. He pays the ferryman generously, and comes to the king&rsquo;s
palace. They were all terrified when they saw that he had the Tartaro
there. They tried to shoot him with cannon, but he caught the bullets,
and sent them back as if they had been balls to play with. They could
not kill him in that way, so they finished him with other arms.</p>
<p>As Petit Perroquet had well gained her, they gave him the princess
in marriage. He sent for his mother to the court, and as they lived
well, so they died happily.</p>

<p class="first">It would only be spoiling good work by bad to attempt
to re-write the exhaustive essay which appears, under the heading of
&ldquo;St. George,&rdquo; in Baring Gould&rsquo;s &ldquo;Curious Myths
of the Middle Ages.&rdquo; He there traces the atmospheric myth in
which the Dragon is the storm-cloud, the Maiden the earth, and the Hero
the sun, through all the forms of the great Aryan legend, in Indian,
Egyptian, Ph&oelig;nician, Italic, Keltic, Teutonic, and Scandinavian
mythology. He shows that it was merely by a mistaken metaphor<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1469src" href="#xd26e1469" name="xd26e1469src">1</a>
that St. George came to assume the place, and wear the glories of the
solar hero; and that England only followed in the wake of other
countries, in making him her national Saint and Patron.</p>
<p>We will, therefore, now only glance at some of the Basque and
Pyrenean forms of this wide-spread myth. M. Cerquand boldly places one
form of the story, which is attached to the house of Belzunce, among
historical legends. But the history of Belzunce and the Dragon stands
in the same relation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21"
name="pb21">21</a>]</span>to the original myth as does that of Guy,
Earl of Warwick, Moor of Moor Hall, and of scores of other heroes. In a
Basque version, collected by ourselves, the concluding words show that
in this form it is simply an Eponymous legend, to account for the name,
&ldquo;and that is whence comes the name of Belzunce.&rdquo; The oldest
Pyrenean version with which we are acquainted is that of the
&ldquo;Serpent d&rsquo;Isabit.&rdquo; We give the outlines of it from
memory, as we heard, and read it, at Bagn&egrave;res de Bigorre.</p>
<p>The serpent lay with his head resting on the summit of the Pic du
Midi de Bigorre, his neck stretched down towards Bar&egrave;ges, while
his body filled the whole valley of Luz, St. Sauveur, and
G&eacute;dres, and his tail was coiled in the hollow below the cirque
of Gavarnie. He fed but once in three months, or the whole country
would have been desolate. With a strong inspiration of his breath, he
drew into his capacious maw, across the valleys, whole flocks of sheep
and goats, herds of oxen, men, women, children, the population of whole
villages at once. He was now asleep, and inert, after such a repast.
The whole male population of several valleys assembled to consult on
what should be done. After long and fruitless debate an old man arose
and spoke:&mdash;&ldquo;We have nearly three months yet before he will
wake; let us cut down all the forests on the opposite hills; then let
us bring all our forges and all the iron we possess, and with the wood
thus cut down let us melt it all into one red-hot fiery mass; then we
will hide ourselves behind the rocks, and make all the noise we can to
try and awaken the monster.&rdquo; So said, so done. The serpent awoke
in a rage at having his slumbers broken, he saw something bright on the
opposite side of the valley, and drew in a long breath, and the fiery
mass, with a roar like a thunderbolt, flew across the valley, right
down the monster&rsquo;s throat. Then, what convulsions ensued; rocks
were uptorn or split open, the mountains were shattered, the glaciers
beaten into dust as the serpent twisted and lashed about in his agony.
To quench his agony of thirst <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href=
"#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>he descended to the valley, and drank
up all the streams from Gavarnie to Pierrefitte. Then, in his last
convulsion, he threw himself back upon the mountain side and expired;
his head rested in a deep hollow; as the fire within him slowly cooled,
the water he had swallowed poured out of his mouth, and formed the
present Lac d&rsquo;Isabit. In M. Cerquand&rsquo;s legend of the Dragon
d&rsquo;Al&ccedil;ay, the red-hot iron is replaced by &ldquo;a
cow&rsquo;s skin full of gunpowder.&rdquo; In all the Basque legends of
this class the hero dies.</p>
<p>But these legends differ widely from the following tales; there is
in them no princess to be rescued, no charcoal-burner, no marriage, or
any other wonders. Were it not for their still closer resemblance to
the Gaelic tales, we should suspect the following legends to be simply
translations of some French legend of St. George. As we remarked
before, like the Deccan cobras, the Heren-Suge is always seven-headed.
It is strange, too, to notice that the princess always behaves in the
same chivalrous way. &ldquo;One is enough to die.&rdquo; The union,
too, of Tartaro and Heren-Suge in the same tale is curious.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Grateful Tartaro and the Heren-Suge.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many of us who are, have been, and shall be in
the world, there was a king, and his wife, and three sons. The king
went out hunting one day, and caught a Tartaro. He brings him home, and
shuts him up in prison in a stable, and proclaims, by sound of trumpet,
that all his court should meet the next day at his house, that he would
give them a grand dinner, and afterwards would show them an animal such
as they had never seen before.</p>
<p>The next day the two sons of the king were playing at ball against
(the wall of) the stable where the Tartaro was confined, and the ball
went into the stable. One of the boys goes and asks the
Tartaro&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw me back my ball, I beg you.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>He says to him, &ldquo;Yes, if you will deliver me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replies, &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; and he threw him the ball.</p>
<p>A moment after, the ball goes again to the Tartaro. He asks for it
again; and the Tartaro says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will deliver me, I will give it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy says, &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; takes his ball, and goes
off.</p>
<p>The ball goes there for the third time, but the Tartaro will not
give it before he is let out. The boy says that he has not the key. The
Tartaro says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your mother, and tell her to look in your right ear,
because something hurts you there. Your mother will have the key in her
left pocket, and take it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy goes, and does as the Tartaro had told him. He takes the key
from his mother, and delivers the Tartaro. When he was letting him go,
he said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do with the key now? I am undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tartaro says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go again to your mother, and tell her that your left ear
hurts you, and ask her to look, and you will slip the key into her
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tartaro tells him, too, that he will soon have need of him, and
that he will only have to call him, and he will be his servant for
ever.</p>
<p>He puts the key back; and everyone came to the dinner. When they had
eaten well, the king said to them that they must go and see this
curious thing. He takes them all with him. When they are come to the
stable, he finds it empty. Judge of the anger of this king, and of his
shame. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to eat the heart, half cooked, and without
salt, of him who has let my beast go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time afterwards the two brothers quarreled in presence of their
mother, and one said to the other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell our father about the affair of the
Tartaro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the mother heard that, she was afraid for her son, and said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take as much money as you wish.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>And she gave him the Fleur-de-lis.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1536src" href="#xd26e1536" name="xd26e1536src">2</a> &ldquo;By
this you will be known everywhere as the son of a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petit Yorge<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1544src" href="#xd26e1544"
name="xd26e1544src">3</a> goes off, then, far, far, far away. He spends
and squanders all his money, and does not know what to do more. He
remembers the Tartaro, and calls him directly. He comes, and Petit
Yorge tells him all his misfortunes; that he has not a penny left, and
that he does not know what will become of him. The Tartaro says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have gone a short way from here you will come to a
city. A king lives there. You will go to his house, and they will take
you as gardener. You will pull up everything that there is in the
garden, and the next day everything will come up more beautiful than
before. Also, three beautiful flowers will spring up, and you will
carry them to the three daughters of the king, and you will give the
most beautiful to the youngest daughter.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1549src" href="#xd26e1549" name="xd26e1549src">4</a></p>
<p>He goes off, then, as he had told him, and he asks them if they want
a gardener. They say, &ldquo;Yes, indeed, very much.&rdquo; He goes to
the garden, and pulls up the fine cabbages, and the beautiful leeks as
well. The youngest of the king&rsquo;s daughters sees him, and she
tells it to her father, and her father says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him alone, we will see what he will do afterwards.&rdquo;
And, indeed, the next day he sees cabbages and leeks such as he had
never seen before. Petit Yorge takes a flower to each of the young
ladies. The eldest said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a flower that the gardener has brought me, which has
not its equal in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the second says that she has one, too, and that no one has ever
seen one so beautiful. And the youngest said that hers was still more
beautiful than theirs, and the others <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>confess it, too. The
youngest of the young ladies found the gardener very much to her taste.
Every day she used to bring him his dinner. After a certain time she
said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad says to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is impossible. The king would not like such a
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl says, too,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, indeed, it is hardly worth while. In eight days I shall
be eaten by the serpent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For eight days she brought him his dinner again. In the evening she
tells him that it is for the last time that she brought it. The young
man tells her, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; that she will bring it again; that
somebody will help her.</p>
<p>The next day Petit Yorge goes off at eight o&rsquo;clock to call the
Tartaro. He tells him what has happened. The Tartaro gives him a fine
horse, a handsome dress, and a sword, and tells him to go to such a
spot, and to open the carriage door with his sword, and that he will
cut off two of the serpent&rsquo;s heads. Petit Yorge goes off to the
said spot. He finds the young lady in the carriage. He bids her open
the door. The young lady says that she cannot open it&mdash;that there
are seven doors, and that he had better go away; that it is enough for
one person to be eaten.</p>
<p>Petit Yorge opens the doors with his sword, and sat down by the
young lady&rsquo;s side. He tells her that he has hurt his ear, and
asks her to look at it;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1581src" href=
"#xd26e1581" name="xd26e1581src">5</a> and at the same time he cuts off
seven pieces of the seven robes which she wore, without the young lady
seeing him. At the same instant comes the serpent, and says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of one, I shall have three to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petit Yorge leaps on his horse, and says to him, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not touch one; you shall not have one of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they begin to fight. With his sword he cuts off one head, and
the horse with his feet another;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1593src"
href="#xd26e1593" name="xd26e1593src">6</a> and the serpent asks
quarter till the next day. Petit Yorge leaves the young lady there. The
young lady is full of joy; she wishes to take the young man home with
her. He will not go by any means (he says); that he cannot; that he has
made a vow to go to Rome; but he tells her that &ldquo;to-morrow my
brother will come, and he will be able to do something, too.&rdquo; The
young lady goes home, and Petit Yorge to his garden. At noon she comes
to him with the dinner, and Petit Yorge says to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see that it has really happened as I told you&mdash;he
has not eaten you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but to-morrow he will eat me. How can it be
otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! To-morrow you will bring me my dinner again. Some
help will come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Petit Yorge goes off at eight o&rsquo;clock to the
Tartaro, who gives him a new horse, a different dress, and a fine
sword. At ten o&rsquo;clock he arrives where the young lady is. He bids
her open the door. But she says to him that she cannot in any way open
fourteen doors; she is there, and that she cannot open them, and he
should go away; that it is enough for one to be eaten; that she is
grieved to see him there. As soon as he has touched them with his
sword, the fourteen doors fly open. He sits down by the side of the
young lady, and tells her to look behind his ear, for it hurts him. At
the same time he cuts off fourteen bits of the fourteen dresses she was
wearing. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>soon as he had done that, the serpent comes,
saying joyfully,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall eat not one, but three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petit Yorge says to him, &ldquo;Not even one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaps on his horse, and begins to fight with the serpent. The
serpent makes some terrible bounds. After having fought a long time, at
last Petit Yorge is the conqueror. He cuts off one head, and the horse
another with his foot. The serpent begs quarter till the next day.
Petit Yorge grants it, and the serpent goes away.</p>
<p>The young lady wishes to take the young man home, to show him to her
father; but he will not go by any means. He tells her that he must go
to Rome, and set off that very day; that he has made a vow, but that
to-morrow he will send his cousin, who is very bold, and is afraid of
nothing.</p>
<p>The young lady goes to her father&rsquo;s, Petit Yorge to his
garden. Her father is delighted, and cannot comprehend it at all. The
young lady goes again with the dinner. The gardener says to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see you have come again to-day, as I told you. To-morrow
you will come again, just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morrow Petit Yorge went off at eight o&rsquo;clock to the
Tartaro. He said to him that the serpent had still three heads to be
cut off, and that he had still need of all his help. The Tartaro said
to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, keep quiet; you will conquer him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives him a new dress, finer than the others, a more spirited
horse, a terrible dog,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1630src" href=
"#xd26e1630" name="xd26e1630src">7</a> a sword, and a bottle of good
scented water.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1633src" href="#xd26e1633"
name="xd26e1633src">8</a> He said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The serpent will say to you, &lsquo;Ah! if I had a spark
between my head and my tail, how I would burn you and your lady, and
your horse and your dog.&rsquo; And you, you will say to him then,
&lsquo;I, if I had the good-scented water to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>smell, I
would cut off a head from thee, the horse another, and the dog
another.&rsquo; You will give this bottle to the young lady, who will
place it in her bosom, and, at the very moment you shall say that, she
must throw some in your face, and on the horse and on the dog as
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes off then without fear, because the Tartaro had given him
this assurance. He comes then to the carriage. The young lady says to
him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going? The serpent will be here directly. It is
enough if he eats me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to her, &ldquo;Open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tells him that it is impossible; that there are twenty-one
doors. This young man touches them with his sword, and they open of
themselves. This young man says to her, giving her the bottle,</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the serpent shall say, &lsquo;If I had a spark between
my head and my tail, I would burn you,&rsquo; I shall say to him,
&lsquo;If I had a drop of the good-scented water under my nose;&rsquo;
you will take the bottle, and throw some over me in a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then makes her look into his ear, and, while she is looking, he
cuts off twenty-one pieces from her twenty-one dresses that she was
wearing. At the same moment comes the serpent, saying, with joy,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of one, I shall have four to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shall not touch one of us, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaps on his spirited horse, and they fight more fiercely than
ever. The horse leaped as high as a house, and the serpent, in a rage,
says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had a spark of fire between my tail and my head, I would
burn you and your lady, and this horse and this terrible
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, if I had the good-scented water under my nose, I would cut
off one of your heads, and the horse another, and the dog
another.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>As he said that, the young lady jumps up, opens the bottle, and very
cleverly throws the water just where it was wanted. The young man cuts
off a head with his sword, his horse another, and the dog another; and
thus they make an end of the serpent. This young man takes the seven
tongues with him, and throws away the heads. Judge of the joy of this
young lady. She wanted to go straight to her father with her preserver
(she says), that her father must thank him too; that he owes his
daughter to him. But the young man says to her that it is altogether
impossible for him; that he must go and meet his cousin at Rome; that
they have made a vow, and that, on their return, all three will come to
her father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>The young lady is vexed, but she goes off without losing time to
tell her father what has happened. The father is very glad that the
serpent was utterly destroyed; and he proclaims in all the country that
he who has killed the serpent should come forward with the proofs of
it.</p>
<p>The young lady goes again with the dinner to the gardener. He says
to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you true, then, that you would not be eaten? Something
has, then, killed the serpent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She relates to him what had taken place.</p>
<p>But, lo! some days afterwards there appeared a black
charcoal-burner, who said that he had killed the serpent, and was come
to claim the reward. When the young lady saw the charcoal-burner, she
said immediately, that most certainly it was not he; that it was a fine
gentleman, on horseback, and not a pest of a man like him. The
charcoal-burner shows the heads of the serpent; and the king says that,
in truth, this must be the man. The king had only one word to say, she
<i>must</i> marry him. The young lady says, she will not at all; and
the father began to compel her, (saying) that no other man came
forward. But, as the daughter would not consent, to make a delay, the
king proclaims in all the country, that he who killed the serpent would
be capable of doing something else, too, and that, on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>such a
day, all the young men should assemble, that he would hang a diamond
ring from a bell, and that whosoever riding under it should pierce the
ring with his sword, should certainly have his daughter.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1689src" href="#xd26e1689" name=
"xd26e1689src">9</a></p>
<p>From all sides arrive the young men. Our Petit Yorge goes off to the
Tartaro, and tells him what has happened, and that he has again need of
him. The Tartaro gives him a handsome horse, a superb dress, and a
splendid sword. Equipped thus, Petit Yorge goes with the others. He
gets ready. The young lady recognizes him immediately, and says so to
her father. He has the good luck to carry off the ring on his sword;
but he does not stop at all, but goes off galloping as hard as his
horse can go. The king and his daughter were in a balcony, looking on
at all these gentlemen. They saw that he still went on. The young lady
says to her father:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, call him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father says to her, in an angry tone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going off, because apparently he has no desire to have
you.&rdquo; And he hurls his lance at him. It strikes him on the leg.
He still rides on. You can well imagine what chagrin for the young
lady.</p>
<p>The next day she goes with the gardener&rsquo;s dinner. She sees him
with his leg bandaged. She asks him what it is.</p>
<p>The young lady begins to suspect something, and goes to tell to her
father how the gardener had his leg tied up, and that he must go and
ask him what is the matter. That he had told her that it was nothing.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king did not want to go, (and said) that she must get it out of
the gardener; but to please his daughter, he says he will go there. He
goes then, and asks him, &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; He tells him
that a blackthorn has run into him. The king gets angry, and says
&ldquo;that there is not a blackthorn in all his garden, and that he is
telling him a lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daughter says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to show it us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shows it to them, and they are astonished to see that the lance
is still there. The king did not know what to think of it all. This
gardener has deceived him, and he must give him his daughter. But Petit
Yorge, uncovering his bosom, shows the &ldquo;fleur-de-lis&rdquo;
there. The king did not know what to say; but the daughter said to
him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my preserver, and I will marry no one else than
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petit Yorge asks the king to send for five dressmakers, the best in
the town, and five butchers. The king sends for them.</p>
<p>Petit Yorge asks the dressmakers if they have ever made any new
dresses which had a piece out; and on the dressmakers saying
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he counts out the pieces and gives them to the
dressmakers, asking if it was like that that they had given the dresses
to the princess. They say, &ldquo;<i>Certainly not.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes, then, to the butchers, and asks them, if they have ever
killed animals without tongues? They say, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; He tells
them, then, to look in the heads of the serpent. They see that the
tongues are not there, and then he takes out the tongues he has.</p>
<p>The king, having seen all that, has nothing more to say. He gives
him his daughter. Petit Yorge says to him, that he must invite his
father to the wedding, but on the part of the young lady&rsquo;s
father; and that they must serve him up at dinner a sheep&rsquo;s
heart, half cooked, and without salt. They make a great feast, and
place this heart before this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=
"#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>father. They make him carve it
himself, and he is very indignant at that. The son then says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected that;&rdquo; and he adds, &ldquo;Ah! my poor
father, have you forgotten how you said that you wished to eat the
heart, half cooked, and without salt, of him who let the Tartaro go?
That is not my heart, but a sheep&rsquo;s heart. I have done this to
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1735" title="Source: recal">recall</span>
to your memory what you said, and to make you recognize me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They embrace each other, and tell each other all their news, and
what services the Tartaro had done him. The father returned happy to
his house, and Petit Yorge lived very happily with his young lady at
the king&rsquo;s house; and they wanted nothing, because they had
always the Tartaro at their service.</p>

<p id="ch2.2">In a variation of the above tale, from the narration of
Mari&ntilde;o Amyot, of St. Jean Pied de Port, the young prince, as a
herdsman, kills with a hammer successively three Tartaros who play at
cards with him; he then finds in their house all their riches and
horses, barrels full of gold and silver, etc., and also three
&ldquo;<i>olano</i>,&rdquo; which is described as an animal who serves
the Tartaro, like a dog, but much larger and more terrible, but also
more intelligent and able to do any message. He kills the serpent with
the aid of the &ldquo;<i>olanos</i>,&rdquo; and the princess helps by
striking the serpent&rsquo;s tail with a sword,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1752src" href="#xd26e1752" name="xd26e1752src">10</a> instead of
sprinkling the &ldquo;sweet-scented water.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;<i>olano</i>&rdquo; then steals dishes off the king&rsquo;s
table for the prince. The charcoal-burner comes; but at last the prince
shows the tongues and pieces of dress, and all ends happily, except for
the charcoal-burner, who is placed on the top of seven barrels of
powder, and fire is applied beneath, and then nobody sees him any more.

<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a mother with
her three sons. The eldest said to her that he wished to go from
country to country, until he should find a situation as servant, and
that she should give him a cake.</p>
<p>He sets out. While he is going through a forest he meets an old
woman, who asks him for a morsel of his cake.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1771src" href="#xd26e1771" name="xd26e1771src">11</a> He says to
her, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; that he would prefer to throw it into the muddy
clay. And the lad asks her if she knows of a servant&rsquo;s place. She
says, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He goes on from forest to forest, until the
night overtakes him. There comes to him a bear. He says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ant of the earth! who has given you permission to come
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who should give it me? I have taken it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the bear devours him.</p>
<p>The second son asks his mother to give him a cake, for he wishes to
go as a servant, like his brother. She gives him one, and he goes away
like his brother. He meets an old woman, who says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a little of your cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer to throw it into this muddy clay rather than to give
you any of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asks her if she knows of a servant&rsquo;s place. She replies,
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; And on he goes, on, on, on, deeper into the forest.
He meets a huge bear. He says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ant of the earth! Who has given you permission to come
here?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=

<p>&ldquo;Who should give it me? I have taken it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the bear devours him.</p>
<p>The third son asks his mother to give him a cake, for he wishes to
go off, like his brothers. He sets off, and walks on, and on, and on.
And he finds an old woman. She asks him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a situation as servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a little bit of your cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Take the whole as well, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! A little bit is enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he asks her if she knows of a servant&rsquo;s place. She says to
him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you will find it far beyond the forest. But you will
meet an enemy here; but I will give you a stick, with the touch of
which you may kill him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1812src"
href="#xd26e1812" name="xd26e1812src">12</a></p>
<p>He goes on, and on, and on. There comes to him a bear, and says to
him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ant of the ground! Who has given you permission to come
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has given it me? I have taken it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad gives him a little blow with his stick, and the bear gives a
howl&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oy, oy, oy!&mdash;spare my life! Oy, oy, oy!&mdash;spare my
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then, how many you are in the place where you
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives him another blow, and he falls stark dead.</p>
<p>He goes on, on, on, until he finds a palace. He goes in, and
asks,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want a servant?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>They say to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; our shepherd has gone away, and we want
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They send him to bed; and the next day they give him a fine flock of
sheep, and tell him not to go on the mountain, because it is full of
large and savage animals, and to pay great attention, because the sheep
always want to go there. The next day he goes off with his sheep, and
all of them run away to this mountain, because the herbage was very
good there. Our shepherd had, fortunately, not forgotten his stick, for
at that moment there appeared before him a terrible bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has given you permission to come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have taken it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He approaches, but our shepherd gives him a little blow with his
stick, and he begins to cry out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oy, oy, oy!&mdash;spare my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then, how many you are where you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were seven yesterday, but to-day we are only six, with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives him another blow, and he falls stark dead. And the shepherd
hides him as well as he can in a hedge, and then he returns home with
his sheep, well filled. That evening the sheep gave him a great deal of
milk, and he made fine cheeses with it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1864src" href="#xd26e1864" name="xd26e1864src">13</a> The master
and mistress were delighted to have such a servant. The next day he
goes off again. As soon as he opened the stable-door the sheep start
off running to the good pasture and fine herbage, and the same things
(happen again). At the end of a moment there appears a bear, who asks
him why he comes there into those parts. Our shepherd, with his stick,
gives him a little blow on the neck, and the bear begins to cry,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, ay!&mdash;spare my life!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>He asks him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many are you there where you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were seven, but at present we are five with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he gives him a little blow, and he falls stiff and dead. And in
five days he kills all the bears in the same way; and when he saw the
last one come, he was frightened to see a beast so immense and so
fearful, and which came dragging himself along, he was so old. He says
to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you come into these parts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the same time the shepherd gives him a little blow. He begins
to cry out to him to spare his life, and that he would give him great
riches and beautiful apartments, and that they should live together. He
spares his life, and sends the flock back to the house. They go through
hedges and hedges, and &ldquo;through the fairies&rsquo;
holes,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1883src" href="#xd26e1883"
name="xd26e1883src">14</a> and arrive at last at a fine palace. There
they find the table set out with every kind of food and drink. There
were also servants to attend on them, and there were also horses all
ready saddled, and with harness of gold and silver. There was nothing
but riches there. After having passed some days there like that, our
shepherd said to himself that it would be better to be master and owner
of all that fortune. So he gives a blow to the bear, and kills him
stark dead.</p>
<p>After having dressed himself splendidly, he gets on horseback, and
goes from country to country, and comes to a city, and hears the bells
sounding, dilin-don, dilin-don, and all the people are in excitement.
He asks, &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; They tell him how that there
is in the mountain a serpent with seven heads, and that one person must
be given to him every day. This serpent has seven heads. They draw lots
to know who must be given to the serpent. The lot had fallen on the
king&rsquo;s daughter, and every one was in grief and distress, and all
were going, with the king at their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37"
href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>head, to accompany her to the
mountain. They left her at the foot of the mountain, and she went on
mounting alone to the top. This young man goes after her, and says to
her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will accompany you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s daughter says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn back, I beg you. I do not wish you to risk your life
because of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear for me. I have a charm of might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time they hear an extraordinary noise and hissing, and
he sees the serpent coming like the lightning. As our man has his stick
with him, he gives him a little blow on one of his heads, and one by
one the seven heads fall off, and our princess is saved.</p>
<p>In order to go to the mountain, she was dressed in her most
beautiful robes. She had seven of them on. He took a little piece from
each of the seven robes, and he likewise takes the tongue from each of
the heads, and puts them in these little pieces of silk. He then takes
the king&rsquo;s daughter on his horse, and descends the mountain. The
daughter goes home to her father, and our gentleman to the bear&rsquo;s
house. The news that the seven-headed serpent is killed spreads
quickly. The king had promised his daughter, and the half of his
kingdom, to the man who should have killed him. The serpent was killed,
as we have said. Three charcoal-burners, passing by on the mountain,
see the serpent, and take the seven heads, and go to the king, asking
to have a reward. But, as they were three, they were in a difficulty;
and they were sent away until the council was assembled, and to see if
any other person would come. As nobody appeared, they were going to
draw lots who should be the husband of the king&rsquo;s daughter. There
was great excitement that day, and there was also a great stir when
this young man arrived in the city. He asks what it is. They tell him
what it is. He was splendidly dressed, and had a magnificent horse. He
asks to see the king, and, as he was handsomely dressed, he is received
immediately. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>He asks if the seven heads of the serpent had
seven tongues in them; and they cannot find them. Then he shows the
seven tongues. He sends, too, for the princess&rsquo; seven robes, and
he shows the seven pieces that are wanting, as well as the seven
tongues. When they see that, all exclaim&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the true saviour of the king&rsquo;s
daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they are married.</p>
<p>The three charcoal-burners, after having been dressed in a coat of
sulphur, were burnt alive in the midst of the market-place.</p>
<p>Our gentleman and lady lived very happily, sometimes at her
father&rsquo;s house and at other times at their own
bear&rsquo;s-house; and, as they had lived well, they died happily.
Then I was there, and now I am here.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Serpent in the Wood.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a widower who
had three daughters. One day the eldest said to her father, that she
must go and see the country. She walked on for two hours, and saw some
men cutting furze, and others mowing hay.</p>
<p>She returned to the house, astonished at having seen such wonderful
things. She told her father what wonderful things she had seen, and her
father replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men cutting furze! Men mowing hay!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second daughter asks, too, to go like her sister, and she
returned after having seen the same things. And the third daughter said
that she ought to go, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, what will you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, like my sisters, something or other.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>She set off on the same road as the others; and she, like the
others, saw men cutting furze, and men mowing hay. She went on further,
and she saw some washerwomen; and she went still a little further on
till she had walked for three hours, and she saw some wood-cutters
cutting firewood. She asked them if she should see anything more if she
went a little further. They told her that she would see some more
wood-cutters cutting firewood.</p>
<p>She went very much farther into the wood, and she was caught, and
kept prisoner by a serpent. She remained there crying, and not able to
eat anything; and she remained like that eight days, very sad; then she
began to grow resigned, and she remained there three years. At the end
of three years she began to wish to return home. The serpent told her
to come back again at the end of two days; that his time was nearly
finished, and that he was a king&rsquo;s son condemned for four
years<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1939src" href="#xd26e1939" name=
"xd26e1939src">15</a> (to be a serpent). He gave her a distaff and
spindle, of silver-gilt, and a silk handkerchief. He said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not find me here on your return, you will have to
wear out seven pairs of shoes, six of leather and one pair of iron ones
(before you will be able to find me).&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she came home, her father would not let her go back to the
house where she had passed such a long time with a son of a king,
condemned to be a serpent. She said that his time was almost finished,
and that in gratitude she ought to return; that he had said that he
would marry her. The father had her put in prison, confined in a room
very high up. The fourth day she escaped, and went to the place, but
she did not find the king&rsquo;s son. She had already shoes on her
feet. She had almost worn them out. After that she bought another pair.
She kept journeying on and on, and asking if it were far, and they told
her that it was very far. She bought still another pair of shoes, and
these, too, got worn out on the road. She bought a fifth pair, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>after them the sixth also. She then asked if she
were near yet, and they told her that she was still very far. Then she
bought the seventh pair of shoes, of iron. And when she had gone a
short way in these shoes, she asked if it were far from there to the
son of the king. The seventh pair of shoes were almost worn out when
she came to a city, and heard sounds of music. She inquired what was
happening in the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a king&rsquo;s son is being married to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to the house, and knocked at the door. A servant came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She asked if there were any work to spin, and she would spin it.</p>
<p>And the servant went to tell it to the mistress. The lady ordered
the servant to bring her in. She brought her in. And when she was in
the kitchen, she showed the silk handkerchief which the king&rsquo;s
son had given her; and she began to blow her nose with that. The lady
was quite astonished to see the girl blow her nose with such a
beautiful handkerchief, as if it were nothing,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1961src" href="#xd26e1961" name="xd26e1961src">16</a> when her
son had one just like it for his marriage-day. So she told her son,
when he came back from the church, that she had a spinster who came
from a great distance, and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a silk handkerchief just like yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the king&rsquo;s son said to his mother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, must see this spinster that you have there.&rdquo;
And he began to go there.</p>
<p>And his mother said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why must you see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to the kitchen, and in his presence she used her silk
handkerchief. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>He said to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too dirty to put into your hands, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman says to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to see it, and show it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Then) he recognised the young girl. She showed him (too) the
distaff and spindle.</p>
<p>At table, when everybody was engaged telling stories, this king
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also have a story to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody was silent, and turned to look at him, and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formerly, I had a key to a chest of drawers, and I lost it,
and had a new one made. (After that, I found the old one.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he turned to his wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I use the old one or the new one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the first was a good one, why should you make use of the
new one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he gave her this answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formerly, I had a wife, and now I have taken you. I leave
you, and take the former one. Do you go off, then, to your own
house.&rdquo;</p>

Campbell, Vol. I., lxxxvii., 8, has some most valuable remarks on the
Keltic Legends, showing the Kelts to be a horse-loving, and not a
seafaring race&mdash;a race of hunters and herdsmen, not of sailors.
The contrary is the case with these Basque tales. The reader will
observe that the ships do nothing extraordinary, while the horses
behave as no horse ever did. It is <i>vice vers&acirc;</i> in the
Gaelic Tales, even when the legends are identical in many
particulars.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

stirrups. Whoever, starting from a given point, can put a

<h2 class="main">III.&mdash;Animal Tales.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We give two stories as specimens of animal tales,
which are neither allegories, nor fables, and still less satires. The
reader must remember the phrase, &ldquo;This happened when animals and
all things could talk.&rdquo; So thoroughly is this believed, that the
first tale of this class recited to us completely puzzled us. The
animals are in them placed so fully on a footing with human
beings&mdash;not in the least as our &ldquo;poor relations,&rdquo; but
rather as sharper-witted, and quite as happy and well off as
ourselves&mdash;that it is difficult at times to determine whether it
is the beast or the man who is the speaker.</p>
<p>Of the latter part of our first story we have heard many variations.
In one given by M. Cerquand, p. 29, note,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2036src" href="#xd26e2036" name="xd26e2036src">1</a> the fox is
represented by Basa-Jauna; in a version from Baigorry, by the Tartaro;
but in three others, from separate localities, he is a fox. The first
two truths are the same in all the versions. In that here given, the
fun is heightened by the fox talking and lisping throughout like a
little child. All these versions we take to be merely fragments of a
much longer story.</p>
<p>In M. Cerquand&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Chandelier of St. Sauveur,&rdquo;
p. 22, the hero&rsquo;s name is Acherihargaix&mdash;&ldquo;the fox
difficult to be caught;&rdquo; and we suspect that he, too, was
originally merely an animal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Acheria, the Fox.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day a fox was hungry. He did not know what to
think. He saw a shepherd pass every day with his flock, and he said to
himself that he ought to steal his milk and his cheese, and to have a
good feast; but he needed some one to help him in order to effect
anything. So he goes off to find a wolf, and he says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf, wolf! we ought to have a feast with such a
shepherd&rsquo;s milk and cheese. You, you shall go to where the flocks
are feeding, and from a distance you must howl, &lsquo;Uhur, uhur,
uhur.&rsquo; The man, after having milked his sheep, drives them into
the field, with his dog, very early in the morning, and he stops at
home to do his work, and then he makes his cheese; and, when you have
begun to howl &lsquo;Uhur, uhur,&rsquo; and the dog to bark, the
shepherd will leave everything else, and will go off full speed. During
this time I will steal the milk, and we will share it when you come to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolf agreed to have a feast, and set out. He did just what the
fox had told him. The dog began to bark when the wolf approached. And
when the man heard that he went off, leaving everything, and our fox
goes and steals the vessel in which the curdled milk was. What does he
do then, before the arrival of the wolf? He gently, gently takes off
the cream, thinly, thinly, and he eats all the contents of the jug.
After he has eaten all, he fills it up with dirt, and puts back the
cream on the top, and he awaits the wolf at the place where he had told
him. The fox says to him, since it is he who is to make the division,
that as the top is much better than the underneath part, the one who
should choose that should have <i>only</i> that, and the other all the
rest. &ldquo;Choose now which you would like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolf says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not have the top; I prefer what is at the
bottom.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fox then takes the top, and gives the poor wolf the vessel full
of dirt.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2064src" href="#xd26e2064" name=
"xd26e2064src">2</a> When he saw that, the wolf got angry; but the fox
said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my fault. Apparently the shepherd makes it like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the fox goes off well filled.</p>
<p>Another day he was again very hungry, and did not know what to
contrive. Every day he saw a boy pass by on the road with his
father&rsquo;s dinner. He says to a blackbird,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackbird, you don&rsquo;t know what we ought to do? We ought
to have a good dinner. A boy will pass by here directly. You will go in
front of him, and when the boy goes to catch you, you will go on a
little farther, limping, and when you shall have done that a little
while the boy will get impatient, and he will put down his basket in
order to catch you quicker. I will take the basket, and will go to such
a spot, and we will share it, and will make a good dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blackbird says to him, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boy passes, the blackbird goes in front of the boy,
limping, limping. When the boy stoops (to catch him), the blackbird
escapes a little further on. At last the boy, getting impatient, puts
his basket on the ground, in order to go quicker after the blackbird.
The fox, who kept watching to get hold of the basket, goes off with it,
not to the place agreed upon, but to his hole, and there he stuffs
himself, eating the blackbird&rsquo;s share as well as his own.</p>
<p>Then he says to himself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do no good stopping here. The wolf is my enemy, and
the blackbird, too. Something will happen to me if I stay here. I must
go off to the other side of the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes and stands at the water&rsquo;s edge. A boatman happened to
pass, and he said to him: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=
"#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! man, ho! Will you, then, cross me over this water? I will
tell you three truths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said to him, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fox jumps (into the boat), and he begins to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;People say that maize bread is as good as wheaten bread. That
is a falsehood. Wheaten bread is better. That is one truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was in the middle of the river, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;People say, too, &lsquo;What a fine night; it is just as
clear as the day!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s a lie. The day is always clearer.
That is the second truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he told him the third as they were getting near the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! man, man, you have a bad pair of trousers on, and they
will get much worse, if you do not pass over people who pay you more
than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true,&rdquo; said the man; and the fox
leapt ashore.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Then I was by the side of the river, and I learnt these three
truths, and I have never forgotten them since.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Ass and the Wolf.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc" lang="eu">Astoa Eta Otsoa.</span></p>
<p>Like many others in the world, there was an ass. He was going along
a ravine, laden with Malaga wine. (You know that asses are very much
afraid of wolves, because the wolves are very fond of the flesh of
asses.) While he was journeying along in that fashion, he sees a wolf
coming at some distance; he could not hide himself anywhere. The wolf
comes up, and the ass says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, good morning, Mr. Wolf; in case you should be
thirsty, I have some excellent Malaga to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not thirsty; no!&mdash;but astoundingly hungry; yes! My
dinner to-day shall be your head and ears.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wolf, if you were good enough to let me go and hear one
mass&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to him, &ldquo;Well! yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our ass goes off then. When he gets into the church he shuts the
door inside with his foot, and stops quietly there.</p>
<p>When the wolf began to get impatient at waiting, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, what a long mass! one would say it was Palm
Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ass said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dirty old wolf, have patience. I am staying here with the
angels, and I have my life (safe) for to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, you bad ass, you are too, too, filthy, you know. If
ever you meet with me again, mass you shall not hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ass said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no dogs round the fold of Alagaia; if you go there
you would get lots of sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolf gives it up, and sets off for the flock where the ass had
told him to go. When the ass saw that he had gone away he came out of
the church, and went home, and took good care not to come near the
wolf&rsquo;s place any more.</p>

<h2 class="main">IV.&mdash;Basa-Jaun, Basa-Andre, and
Lami&ntilde;ak.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is somewhat difficult to get a clear view of what
Basa-Jaun and Basa-Andre, the wild man and the wild woman, really are
in Basque mythology. In the first tale here given Basa-Jaun appears as
a kind of vampire, and his wife, the Basa-Andre, as a sorceress, but we
know of no other such representation of the former. Basa-Jaun is
usually described by Basque writers as a kind of satyr, or faun, a
wood-sprite; and Basques; in speaking of him to us, have frequently
used the French term, &ldquo;Homme de Bouc,&rdquo;
&ldquo;He-goat-man,&rdquo; to describe him. In some tales he appears
rather as a species of brownie, and has received the familiar sobriquet
of Ancho,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2160src" href="#xd26e2160" name=
"xd26e2160src">1</a> from the Spanish Sancho. In this character he
haunts the shepherds&rsquo; huts in the mountains, warms himself at
their fires, tastes their clotted milk and cheese, converses with them,
and is treated with a familiarity which, however, is never quite free
from a hidden terror. His wife, the Basa-Andre, appears sometimes as a
sorceress, sometimes as a kind of land-mermaid, as a beautiful lady
sitting in a cave and &ldquo;combing her locks with a comb of
gold,&rdquo; in remote mountain parts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2170src" href="#xd26e2170" name="xd26e2170src">2</a></p>
<p>The Lami&ntilde;ak are true fairies, and do not differ more from the
general run of Keltic fairies than the Scotch, Irish, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>Welsh,
and Cornish fairies do from each other. In fact, the legends are often
identical. The Lami&ntilde;ak were described to us by one who evidently
believed in, and dreaded them, as little people who lived underground.
Another informant stated that they were little people who came down the
chimney. They long to get possession of human beings, and change and
carry off infants unbaptized, but they do not seem to injure them
otherwise. They bring good luck to the houses which they frequent; they
are fond of cleanliness, but always speak and give their orders in
words exactly the opposite of their meaning. In common with Basa-Jaun
and Basa-Andre they hate church bells,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2182src" href="#xd26e2182" name="xd26e2182src">3</a> and though
not actively hostile to Christianity, are driven away as it advances.
They were formerly great builders of bridges, and even of
churches,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2188src" href="#xd26e2188" name=
"xd26e2188src">4</a> but were usually defrauded of their wage, which
was to have been power over some human soul at the completion of the
contract. Fairies&rsquo; wells and fountains are common in the Landes
and neighbouring Gascon provinces, but we know of none in the Pays
Basque.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2194src" href="#xd26e2194" name=
"xd26e2194src">5</a> We failed distinctly to make out what are the
&ldquo;fairies&rsquo; holes (Lami&ntilde;a-ziloak),&rdquo; spoken of in
the Heren-Suge tale (p. 36); as far as we could gather from the
narrator they are simply bare places in hedges, when covered by the web
of the gossamer spider. We know of no dances by moonlight on fairy
rings of green herbage; but if the reader will carefully eliminate from
his memory the rare fancies of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson about Puck,
Oberon, and Titania, he will find little otherwise to differentiate
between the Basque Lami&ntilde;ak and the fairies of Sir Walter Scott,
of Campbell, and of Croker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Irish Legends.&rdquo; One
peculiarity certainly is that all the Basque Lami&ntilde;ak are
sometimes said to be all called &ldquo;Gu&iuml;llen,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2197src" href="#xd26e2197" name="xd26e2197src">6</a>
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>appears to be the same as the French Guillaume,
and our William.</p>
<p>It must be a sign of a failing belief and interest that witches and
fairies are so often confounded. In these few stories it is evident
that the witch is often a fairy, and the fairy a witch.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there lived in one house the landlady
and the farmer&rsquo;s wife.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2210src" href=
"#xd26e2210" name="xd26e2210src">7</a> The farmer&rsquo;s wife had
three sons; one day they said to their mother to give each of them a
ball and a penny roll, that they wished to go from country to country.
The mother was sorry to part with her three much-loved sons; but all
three started off.</p>
<p>When they were in the midst of a forest they saw that night was
coming on, and the eldest brother said that he would climb up the first
tree. He finds a tall tree, and climbs up to the top, to the very
tip-top, and the second says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;No, no; there&rsquo;s nothing to be seen, nothing;
not a feather! nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down then; you are an old donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the second climbs, and he sees nothing. The third says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are no good at all, you others. I will climb
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he climbs to the top, to the very tip-top. The others say to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you not see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I see a long column of smoke, but very, very thin, and
far, very far away. Let us go towards that.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the three brothers set out together. At eight o&rsquo;clock in
the evening they come to a grand castle, and they knock at the door,
and the Basa-Andre (wild woman) comes to answer. She asks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they reply, &ldquo;It is we who are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, young children? Where are you going to at
this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ask and beg of you to give us shelter for to-night; we
will be satisfied with a corner of the floor, poor wretches as we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my husband, the Basa-Jaun, and if he catches you he
will eat you; that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he catches us outside he will eat us all the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she let these three brothers come in, and she hides the three
in three different corners. Afterwards, at nine o&rsquo;clock, the
Basa-Jaun comes. He made a great noise and blustering, and then the
Basa-Andre goes out, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nobody here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have somebody; bring them out, or else I will eat
you myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she goes and brings out the eldest brother, trembling with
fright. The Basa-Jaun says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be my servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to him, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Basa-Jaun begins again to sniff about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have still somebody else here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she brings out the second, and he says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be servant to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, he smelled the smell of some one, and at the third time she
brings out the third, and he says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All three of you shall sup with me to-night, and afterwards
we shall go to bed. But to-morrow we will all go hunting.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>And they go hunting the next day until eight o&rsquo;clock in the
evening.</p>
<p>Now, they had at home a little sister. She was little then, but in
time she grew up. One day the landlady and the farmer&rsquo;s wife had
put out the new maize in the garden to dry; and when no one saw her,
the little girl took some from her mistress&rsquo; heap, and put it to
her own. When the mistress saw that, she began to cry out, saying to
her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bold hussey that you are, there is no one like you! You will
come to a bad end like your brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the young girl began to cry, and goes to find her mother, and
says to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, had I any brothers?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2288src" href="#xd26e2288" name="xd26e2288src">8</a></p>
<p>She says to her, &ldquo;Yes, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, they went away a long time ago,&rdquo; she said to
her.</p>
<p>This little girl says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, must be off to-day. Give me a distaff to spin with,
and a penny cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sets off, and comes to the house of the Basa-Jaun, and she
knocks at the door, and she lets her in. While his wife was telling her
that it is the house of the Basa-Jaun, the elder brother comes in; but
they did not recognise one another at all. And afterwards Basa-Jaun
comes, and says, as he enters the house:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have something here for me,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And immediately she shows her. Basa-Jaun says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you engage yourself as my servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She says to him, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some days afterwards the brothers recognised their sister, and they
embraced each other very much. And this young girl who was so well
before began to grow thin. And one day one of her brothers asked her:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you that you are getting thin like
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The master every evening asks me to put my little finger
through the door, and he sucks the finger through the door, and I
become every day more sad and more languid.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2327src" href="#xd26e2327" name="xd26e2327src">9</a></p>
<p>One day, when the Basa-Andre was not at home, these brothers and the
sister plotted together to kill Basa-Jaun, if they could catch him in a
ravine in a certain place. And they kill him.</p>
<p>One day the wife asks,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Basa-Jaun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Basa-Andre takes out three large teeth, and brings them to the
house, and tells this young girl herself, when she heats the water for
her brothers&rsquo; feet in the evening, to put one tooth in the water
of each.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2339src" href="#xd26e2339" name=
"xd26e2339src">10</a> And as soon as the third had finished washing the
three brothers became oxen; and this young girl used to drive all three
into the fields. And this young girl lived there on the birds they (the
oxen) found, and nothing else.</p>
<p>One day, as she was passing over a bridge,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2347src" href="#xd26e2347" name="xd26e2347src">11</a> she sees
Basa-Andre under, and says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not make these three oxen men as they were before,
I will put you into a red-hot oven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answers her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! go to such a dell, and take thence three hazel
sticks,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2356src" href="#xd26e2356" name=
"xd26e2356src">12</a> and strike each of them three blows on the
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she did what she told her, and they were changed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>into men
the same as they were before; and all the brothers and the sister lived
happily together in Basa-Jaun&rsquo;s castle, and as they lived well
they made a good end also.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Servant at the Fairy&rsquo;s.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a woman who had three
daughters. One day the youngest said to her that she must go out to
service. And going from town to town, she met at last a fairy who asked
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she answered, &ldquo;Do you know a place for a
servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; if you will come to my house I will take you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave her her morning&rsquo;s work to do, and said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are fairies. I must go from home, but your work is in the
kitchen; smash the pitcher, break all the plates, pound the children,
give them breakfast (by themselves), dirty their faces, and rumple
their hair.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2384src" href=
"#xd26e2384" name="xd26e2384src">13</a></p>
<p>While she was at breakfast with the children, a little dog comes to
her and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tchau, tchau, tchow; I too, I want something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off from here, silly little dog; I will give you a
kick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the dog did not go away; and at last she gave him something to
eat&mdash;a little, not much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I will tell you what the
mistress has told you to do. She told you to sweep the kitchen, to fill
the pitcher, and to wash all the plates, and that if it is all well
done she will give you the choice of a sack of charcoal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>or of a
bag of gold; of a beautiful star on your forehead, or of a
donkey&rsquo;s tail hanging from it. You must answer, &lsquo;A sack of
charcoal and a donkey&rsquo;s tail.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mistress comes. The new servant had done all the work, and she
was very well satisfied with her. So she said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose which you would like, a sack of charcoal or a bag of
gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sack of charcoal is the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A star for your forehead, or a donkey&rsquo;s
tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A donkey&rsquo;s tail would be the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she gives her a bag of gold, and a beautiful star on her
forehead.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2412src" href="#xd26e2412" name=
"xd26e2412src">14</a> Then the servant goes home. She was so pretty
with this star, and this bag of gold on her shoulders, the whole family
was astonished at her. The eldest daughter says to her mother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, I will go and be a servant too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she says to her, &ldquo;No, my child, you shall not do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as she would not leave her in peace (she assented), and she goes
off like her sister. She comes into the city of the fairies, and meets
the same fairy as her sister did. She says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, my girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be a servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she takes her as servant. She tells her like the first one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will dig up the kitchen, break the plates, smash the
pitcher, give the children their breakfasts by themselves, and dirty
their faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some of the breakfast left over, and the little dog comes
in, and he went:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tchow! tchow! tchow! I too, I should like
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he follows her everywhere, and she gives him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>nothing;
and at last she drove him off with kicks. The mistress comes home, and
she finds the kitchen all dug up, the pitcher and all the plates
broken. And she asks the servant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you ask for wages? A bag of gold or a sack of
charcoal? a star on your forehead, or a donkey&rsquo;s tail
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She chose the bag of gold and a star on her forehead; but she gave
her a sack of charcoal, and a donkey&rsquo;s tail for her forehead. She
goes away crying, and tells her mother that she comes back very sorry.
And the second daughter also asks permission to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; (says the mother), and she stops at home.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Fairy in the House.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once upon a time a gentleman and lady. And
the lady was spinning one evening. There came to her a fairy, and they
could not get rid of her; and they gave her every evening some ham to
eat, and at last they got very tired of their fairy.</p>
<p>One day the lady said to her husband:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot bear this fairy; I wish I could drive her
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the husband plots to dress himself up in his wife&rsquo;s
clothes just as if it was she, and he does so. The wife goes to bed,
and the husband remains in the kitchen alone, and the fairy comes as
usual. And the husband was spinning. The fairy says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same to you too; sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you made <i>chirin, chirin</i>, but now you make
<i>firgilun, fargalun</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2482src"

<p>The man replies, &ldquo;Yes, now I am tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As his wife used to give her ham to eat, the man offers her some
also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take your supper now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you please,&rdquo; replies the fairy.</p>
<p>He puts the frying-pan on the fire with a bit of ham. While that was
cooking, and when it was red, red-hot, he throws it right into the
fairy&rsquo;s face. The poor fairy begins to cry out, and then come
thirty of her friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has done any harm to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, to myself; I have hurt myself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2501src" href="#xd26e2501" name="xd26e2501src">16</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have done it yourself, cure it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the fairies go off, and since then there came no more
fairies to that house. This gentleman and lady were formerly so well
off, but since the fairy comes no longer the house little by little
goes to ruin, and their life was spent in wretchedness. If they had
lived well they would have died well too.</p>

<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a mother who had a very
beautiful daughter. The mother was always bustling about, but the
daughter would not do anything. So she gave her such a good beating
that she sat down on a flat stone to cry. One day the young owner of
the castle went by. He asks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes such a pretty girl cry like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman answers him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As she is too pretty she will not work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man asks if she knows how to sew. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>She answers, &ldquo;Yes; if she liked she could make seven shirts a
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This young gentleman is much smitten with her. He goes home, and
brings a piece of linen, and says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are seven shirts, and if you finish them by such a time
we will marry together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat thinking without doing anything, and with tears in her eyes.
Then comes to her an old woman, who was a witch, and says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it makes you so sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answers, &ldquo;Such a gentleman has brought me seven shirts to
sew, but I cannot do them. I am sitting here thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This old woman says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how to sew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how to thread the needle; (that is all).&rdquo;</p>
<p>This woman says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make your shirts for you when you want them, if you
remember my name in a year and a day.&rdquo; And she adds, &ldquo;If
you do not remember I shall do with you whatever I like. Marie
Kirikitoun&mdash;nobody can remember my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she agreed. She makes her the seven shirts for the appointed
time. When the young man came the shirts were made, and he takes the
young girl with joy and they are both married.</p>
<p>But this young girl grew continually sadder and sadder; though her
husband made great feasts for her she never laughed. One day they had a
frightfully grand festival. There came to the door an old woman, and
she asks the servant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the reason that you have such grand
feastings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answers, &ldquo;Our lady never laughs at all, and her husband
has these grand feasts to make her gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman replied: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If she saw what I have heard this day she would laugh most
certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant said to her, &ldquo;Stay here; I will tell her so at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They call the old woman in, and she told them that she had seen an
old woman leaping and bounding from one ditch to another, and saying
all the time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Houpa, houpa, Marie Kirikitoun; nobody will remember my
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this young lady heard that, she was merry at once, and writes
down this name at once. She recompensed highly the old woman, and she
was very happy; and when the other old woman came she knew her
name.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2583src" href="#xd26e2583" name=

<h3 class="main">The Devil&rsquo;s Age.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a gentleman and lady who were very poor.
This man used to sit sadly at a cross-roads. There came to him a
gentleman, who asked: &ldquo;Why are you so sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have not wherewith to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said to him, &ldquo;I will give you as much money as you like, if
at such a time you tell the age of the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our man goes off happy. He leads a merry life with his wife, for
they wanted for nothing. They lived at a great rate. But time went on,
and <i>the</i> time was approaching. This man recollected that he had
not busied himself at all about the devil&rsquo;s age. He became
pensive. His wife asked him what was the matter with him then? why is
he not happy? that they wanted for nothing; why is he so sad? He tells
her how it is that he got rich, and what compact he had made with a
gentleman. His wife said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have nothing but that, it is nothing at all.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>Get into a barrel of honey, and when you come out
of it get into another barrel of feathers, and dressed like that go to
the cross-roads and wait for the devil there. You will put yourself on
all fours, and walk backwards and forwards, and go between his legs,
and walk all round him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man does as his wife had told him. The devil comes, and draws
back (when he sees him); and our man goes up quite close to the devil.
The devil being frightened said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so many years old, and I have never seen any animal like
that, and such a frightful one.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Our man had heard enough. He went off home at full speed, and told
his wife that they would want for nothing, that he had done as she had
told him, just as if she had been a witch, and that he was no longer
afraid of the devil. They lived rich and happily, and if they lived
well, they died well too.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were, like many others in the world, a man and a
woman over-burthened with children, and very poor. The woman no more
knew what to do. She said that she would go and beg. She goes off, far,
far, far away, and she arrives at the city of the fairies. After she
had told them how many children she had, all give her a great many
alms&mdash;she was laden with them.</p>
<p>The queen of the fairies gives her besides twenty pounds in gold,
and says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give me your child when you are
confined&mdash;you shall bring it up in your law&mdash;I will give you
a great deal of money, if you will do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told her that the godmother was already decided <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>upon,
but that she would speak about it to her husband. The queen told her to
go home, and to return with the answer in a week.</p>
<p>She gets home as she best can, very much fatigued by her burthen.
Her husband was astonished that she could have carried so much. She
tells him what had happened with the queen of the fairies. He says to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, we will make her godmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she returns at the end of a week to tell the queen that she
accepts her. She tells her not to send and tell her when she is
confined, that she will know it herself, and that she will come all
right. At the end of a week she is confined of a daughter. The queen
arrives, as she had said, with a mule laden with gold. When they came
back from the christening, the godmother and the child fly away; and
the parents console themselves with their other children, thinking that
she will be happier in the house of the queen of the fairies.</p>
<p>The queen takes her to a corner of a mountain. It is there where her
house was. She had already another god-daughter; this was a little dog,
whose name was Rose,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2652src" href=
"#xd26e2652" name="xd26e2652src">21</a> and she named this last
god-daughter Pretty-Rose. She gave her, too, a glint of diamonds in the
middle of her forehead.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2655src" href=
"#xd26e2655" name="xd26e2655src">22</a> She was very pretty. She grew
up in the corner of the mountain, amusing herself with this dog. She
said to her one day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the queen no other houses? I am tired of being always
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog said to her: &ldquo;Yes, she has a very fine one by the side
of the king&rsquo;s highway, and I will speak to my godmamma about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the dog then told her how Pretty-Rose was bored, and (asked her)
if she would not change her house. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>said to her,
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and off they go. While they were there one day
Pretty-Rose was on the balcony, and a king&rsquo;s son passes, and he
was astonished at the beauty of Pretty-Rose; and the king begged and
prayed her to look at him again, and (asked her) if she would not go
with him. She told him, &ldquo;No, that she must tell it to her
godmamma.&rdquo; Then the dog said, aside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, without me she shall not go anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This king says to her: &ldquo;But I will take you, too, willingly;
but how shall I get you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose says to him: &ldquo;As I give every evening to my godmother
always a glass of good liqueur to make her sleep well, as if by
mistake, instead of half a glass, I will give her the glass full, and
as she will not be able to rise any more to shut the door as usual, I,
I will go and take the key to shut it. I will pretend to, and will give
her back the key, leaving the door open, and you will open it when you
come. She will not hear anything; she will be in a deep
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s son said that he would come at midnight, in his
flying chariot.</p>
<p>When night came, Rose gave her godmother the good drink in a glass,
brim, brim-full. The godmother said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! what! child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will sleep all the better, godmamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; and she drinks it all.</p>
<p>But she could not any more get up to shut the door, she had become
so sleepy.</p>
<p>Rose said to her: &ldquo;Godmamma! I will shut the door to-day; stop
where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave her the key, and Rose turns and turns it back again and
again in the keyhole as if she had locked it; and leaving it unlocked
she gave the key to her godmother, and she puts it in her pocket. She
goes to bed; but Rose and Pretty-Rose did not go to bed at all. At
midnight the son of the king arrives with his flying chariot. Rose and
Pretty-Rose get into it, and go to this young man&rsquo;s house. The
next day Rose says to Pretty-Rose: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not so pretty as you were yesterday;&rdquo; and
looking at her closely, &ldquo;I find you very ugly to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pretty-Rose said to her: &ldquo;My godmamma must have taken away my
diamond glint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she said to Rose, &ldquo;You must go to my godmamma, and ask her
to give me back the glint that I had before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose did not want to go there&mdash;she was afraid; but Pretty-Rose
prayed her so much, that she took off the silver dress and set
out.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2702src" href="#xd26e2702" name=
"xd26e2702src">23</a> When she came to the mountain, she began to call
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Godmamma! godmamma! Give Pretty-Rose her beautiful glint as
before. I shall be angry with you for always (if you do not), and you
will see what will happen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The godmother said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, come in, I will give you breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;I am afraid you will beat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! come quickly, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will give Pretty-Rose her glint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, she has it already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then goes in. The queen washes her feet and wipes them, and puts
her upon the velvet cushion, and gives her some chocolate; and says to
her, that she knows where Pretty-Rose is, and that she will be married,
and to tell her from her not to trouble herself about her toilet, nor
about anything that is necessary for the wedding and feast, that she
would come on the morning of the day.</p>
<p>Rose goes off then. While she is going through the city where
Pretty-Rose is, she hears two ladies, who were saying to two gentlemen,
&ldquo;What kind of wife is it that our brother is going to take? Not
like us, because he keeps her shut up so close. Let us go and see
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little dog said to them, &ldquo;Not a bit like you, you horrible
blubber-lips, as you are. You shall see her&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the young kings heard that, they were ready to run their swords
through the poor little dog. When she gets to Pretty-Rose&rsquo;s house
she hides herself, and tells her all that has happened. Pretty-Rose
gives her some good liqueur to drink, and she comes to herself. The
king makes a proclamation that whoever shall (merely) spit where the
little dog shall have placed her feet shall be killed, and to mind and
pay attention to it.</p>
<p>When the marriage day had arrived, came the queen. She brought for
the wedding-day a robe of diamonds; for the next day, of gold; and for
the third day, of silver. Judge how beautiful she was with her glint of
diamonds, and her dress of diamonds, too. They could not look at her.
Her godmother told her to have her sisters-in-law there, and not to be
afraid of them; that they could not come near her in beauty. When she
went out (of her room) on the wedding-day, her sisters-in-law could not
look at her, she dazzled them so much. They said to each other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little dog was right when she said she was beautiful,
this lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And for three days Pretty-Rose walked about,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2735src" href="#xd26e2735" name="xd26e2735src">24</a> and every
one was astounded at her beauty. When the feast was over, the godmother
went home. Rose would not leave Pretty-Rose. The godmother told
Pretty-Rose that she was born of poor parents, and that she had once
helped them, but that what she had given them must be already
exhausted. Pretty-Rose gave them enough for all to live grandly. She
herself had four children, two boys and two girls; and if they had
lived well, they had died well.</p>

<h2 class="main">V.&mdash;Witchcraft and Sorcery.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Our legends of witchcraft and sorcery are very poor,
and in some of these, as said above, the witch is evidently a fairy.
The reason of this is not that the belief in witchcraft is extinct
among the Basques, but because it is so rife. Of stories of witchcraft
(as matters of fact), and some of them very sad ones, we have heard
plenty; but of legends, very few. In fact, witchcraft among the Basques
has not yet arrived at the legendary stage. The difference is felt at
once in taking down their recitations. In the legends they are reciting
a text learnt by heart. It is &ldquo;the story says so.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; whether they understand it or not. But they
tell their stories of witchcraft in their own words, just as they would
narrate any other facts which they supposed had happened to themselves
or to their neighbours. One woman told us, as a fact within her own
knowledge, and persisted in it, a tale which appears both in M.
Cerquand&rsquo;s pages and in Fr. Michel&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Pays Basque</span>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2754src"
href="#xd26e2754" name="xd26e2754src">1</a> It was only after
cross-examination that we could discover that it had not really
happened to her own daughter, but that she had only <i>seen</i> the
cottage and the chapel which are the scene of the alleged occurrence.
We have, too, been informed on undoubted authority that, only a year or
two back, a country <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>priest was sorely puzzled by one of his
parishioners, in his full senses, seriously and with contrition
confessing to him that he frequented the &ldquo;Sabbat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what is strange and unexpected is, that with this prevalence of
belief in witchcraft and sorcery, and which can be traced back to our
earliest notices of the Basques, there is nothing to differentiate
their belief on this subject from the current European belief of three
centuries back. All the Basque words for witchcraft and sorcery are
evidently borrowed. The only purely Basque term is Asti, which seems to
be rather a diviner than a sorcerer. The term for the
&ldquo;Sabbat&rdquo; is &ldquo;Akhelarre&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;goat
pasture&rdquo;&mdash;and seems to be taken from the apparition of the
devil there in form of a goat, which is not uncommon elsewhere. Pierre
de Lancre, by the terrors of his hideous inquisition in 1609, produced
a moral epidemic, and burnt numerous victims at St. Jean de Luz; but
there is not a single Basque term in all his pages. Contrary to general
opinion, both the Spanish Inquisition and the French ecclesiastical
tribunals were more merciful and rational, and showed far less bigotry
and barbarity than the two doctrinaire lawyers and judges of Bordeaux.
The last person burnt for witchcraft at St. Jean de Luz was a
Portuguese lady, who was accused of having secreted the Host for
purposes of magic, in 1619. While her case was being investigated
before the Bishop of Bayonne, in the crypt of the church, a mob of
terrified fishermen, on the eve of starting for Newfoundland, burst in,
tore her out of the church, and burnt her off-hand, in the midst of the
&ldquo;Place.&rdquo; &ldquo;They dared not,&rdquo; they said,
&ldquo;sail while such a crime was unpunished.&rdquo; The
Bishop&rsquo;s proc&eacute;s-verbal of the occurrence is still extant
in the archives of the Mairie.</p>
<p>The magic wand in all our tales is now said to be made from the
hazel. In De Lancre&rsquo;s time it was from the
&ldquo;Souhandourra&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the cornus
sanguinea&rdquo;&mdash;or dog-wood. This was then the witches&rsquo;
tree. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=

<p class="first">Once upon a time, like many others in the world, there
was a young lad. He was one day in a lime-kiln, and the witches came at
night. They used to dance there, and one pretended to be the mistress
of a house, who was very ill; and one day, as she was going out of the
church, she let the holy wafer fall on the ground, and a toad had
picked it up; and this toad is still near the door, under a stone, with
the bread in his mouth.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2778src" href=
"#xd26e2778" name="xd26e2778src">3</a> And again, this same witch said
that, until they took away this bread out of the toad&rsquo;s mouth,
this lady will not be cured. This young lad had heard it all. When they
had danced their rounds, the witches go away home, and our lad comes
out of the lime-kiln, and goes to the house of this lady who is ill,
and says to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what must be done to cure you,&rdquo; and he told her
all that he had heard from the witch.</p>
<p>The sick lady did what they told her, and the same day she was
cured, and the young man was well paid.</p>
<p>And that very evening there came to him a hunch-backed girl, and
said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that you know where the witches hold their
Sabbat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow I think I should like to hear what the witches
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he points out to her the hole of the lime-kiln. And at midnight
all the witches came, some from one quarter, some from
another&mdash;some laughing, and others cutting capers. The witches
said one to another,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must look in the lime-kiln, to see what may be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go to look, and they find the hunchback girl, and they send her
off&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go&mdash;through hedges and hedges, through thorns and
thorns, through furze-bushes and furze-bushes, scratches and
pricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in no way could our poor hunchback find her way home. All torn
to pieces and exhausted, at last, in the morning, she arrived at her
house.</p>

<p>The second part of this story is evidently a blundered version,
transferred from fairies to witches, of Croker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Legend of
Knochgrafton&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fairy Legends of South of Ireland,&rdquo;
p. 10); and M. Cerquand, Part II., p. 17, has a Basque version,
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Les Deux Bossus</span>,&rdquo; almost identical
with this Irish legend. The tale, as given in Croker, is found in the
Bearnais Gascon, in Spanish, Italian, and German. It is evident, we
think, that the Basque land is not its home, but that it has travelled
there. We have also another Basque variation of the first part, in
which two lads hear the witches at the Sabbat say that a king&rsquo;s
daughter can only be cured by eating an ox&rsquo;s heart. The opening
of this story is so different, that we here give it:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Witches and the Idiots.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there were two brothers, the one an
idiot, and the other a fool. They had an old mother, old, old, very
old. One morning early the elder arranges to go with his sheep to the
mountain, and he leaves the fool at home with his old, old, mother, and
said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give my mother some chocolate now, and you will give
her a hot bath (afterwards), quite, quite, hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes to the mountain with his sheep. The second son put the water
on to boil, and said to his mother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, the water is hot, what bath would you
like?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2825src" href="#xd26e2825"
name="xd26e2825src">4</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href=
"#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>She says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bath with wood-ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he carries it to the bed while it is boiling; and as she did not
get up, he said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like a little broth?&rdquo; And she said
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, get up quickly!&rdquo; and she did not get up.</p>
<p>He takes her, and puts her himself into this boiling water, so that
he boiled his poor mother. And he said to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, get up again; the water is not cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer. The night comes, and the other brother returns
from the mountains, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is our mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you given her the bath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but she is still there, and she is asleep in her
bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and see if she is still asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes, and says, &ldquo;No, no; she is laughing&mdash;she keeps on
laughing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other brother goes there, and perceives that their mother is
quite dead. He did not know what to do. They both go into the garden,
and there they make a great hole and bury her.</p>
<p>They then burn the house, go into the woods, see the witches, cure
the king&rsquo;s daughter, whom one of them marries, and they live
happily.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2862src" href="#xd26e2862" name=
"xd26e2862src">5</a></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is <i>possible</i> that this first part may be a narrative of
fact. We knew at Ast&eacute;, near Bagn&egrave;res de Bigorre, a
brother, an idiot &ldquo;cr&eacute;tin,&rdquo; who deliberately began
to chop up his sister (also an idiot and &ldquo;cr&eacute;tin&rdquo;),
who offered no resistance. He had chopped off several of her fingers,
when they were accidently interrupted. In spite of the blood and pain,
she was only laughing at it.</p>
<p>We have another tale of this kind, which may be also founded on
fact, so sad is often the condition of the cr&eacute;tins <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>in the
mountains. It is of a mother and her imbecile son; he nearly kills
himself by chopping off the branch of the tree on which he was sitting.
Then he believes himself dead, and commits various other follies. His
mother thinks a wife might be able to take care of him, and tells him
to cast sheeps&rsquo; eyes at the young girls coming out of church
after mass. He takes this literally, cuts out the eyes of all their
flock, and so kills their sheep, the only thing they had, and throws
these at the girls, who are disgusted, and quarrel with him. He goes
home, and mother and son end their lives together in wretchedness.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Witch and the New-Born Infant.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a man and
woman, labourers, who lived by their toil. They were at ease. They had
a mule, and the man lived by his mule carrying wine. Sometimes he was a
week away from home. He always went to the same inn, where there was a
woman and her daughter. One day the labourer sets off with his loaded
mule, and his wife was very near her confinement. She was expecting it
hourly; but, as he had orders upon orders, he was obliged to set off.
He goes then, and comes to this inn. It was a market-day, and they had
not kept a bedroom for him as usual, because there were so many people
there, and he is put into a dark room without windows near the kitchen.
He had not yet gone to sleep, when he hears the woman say to her
daughter,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not aware that the wife of the man who is there is
confined? Go and see if he is asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the man heard that, he began to snore; and when the young girl
heard through a slit in the door that he was snoring, she said to her
mother,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, he is asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother said to her then (you may guess whether he was
listening)&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go and charm this newly-born infant.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>She takes up a stone under the hearth, and takes from under it a
saucepan, in which there was an ointment. She takes a brush, and well
rubs herself over her whole body, saying,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2895src" href="#xd26e2895" name="xd26e2895src">6</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Under</i> all the clouds and <i>over</i> all the hedges,
half an hour on the road, another half-hour there, and another to
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she had said that, off she went. When the man saw that
she was gone, he comes out of his room. He had seen what she did. He
anoints himself like her, and says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Over</i> the clouds, and <i>under</i> the
hedges&rdquo;&mdash;(he made a blunder there<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2916src" href="#xd26e2916" name=
"xd26e2916src">7</a>)&mdash;&ldquo;a quarter of an hour to go there,
half an hour to stop, and a quarter of an hour for the
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arrives at his house, but torn to pieces by the thorns, and his
clothes in strips, but that was all the same to him; he places himself
behind the door of his wife&rsquo;s bedroom with a big stick. There
comes a great white cat, &ldquo;Miau, miau!&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2925src" href="#xd26e2925" name="xd26e2925src">8</a> When the
man heard that, he goes out of the place where he was hiding, and with
his stick he almost killed this cat, and set out directly afterwards
for the inn, but not easily, under all the hedges. In spite of that, he
arrives at the woman&rsquo;s house. He goes to bed quickly. The next
day, when he gets up, he sees only the daughter. He asks her where her
mother is. &ldquo;She is ill, and you must pay me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I prefer to see your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes to the mother, and finds her very ill. From this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>day he goes no more to that inn. When he gets
home, he tells his wife what had happened, and how he had saved the
child. But all was not ended there. They had misfortune upon
misfortune. All their cows died, and all their other animals too. They
were sinking into the deepest misery.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2937src" href="#xd26e2937" name="xd26e2937src">9</a> They did not
know what would become of them. This man was brooding sadly in thought,
when he met an old woman, who asked him what was the matter with him.
He told her all his troubles, how many misfortunes they had
had&mdash;all his cows lost. He had bought others, and they too had
died directly. He is charmed by witches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are like that you have only to put a consecrated taper
under the peck measure in the stable, and you will catch
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He does as the old woman told him, and hides himself in the manger.
At midnight she comes under the form of a cat, and gets astride the ox,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others before were fine, but this is very much
finer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When our man heard that he comes out from where he was hiding, and
with his stick he leaves her quite dead; although when he had done that
our man was without any resources; (he had) neither bread, nor maize,
nor cows, nor pigs, and his wife and children were starving.</p>
<p>He goes off to see if he can do anything. There meets him a
gentleman, who says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, man, that you are so sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this misery that I am in that torments me
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have only that, we will arrange all that if you like.
I will give you as much money as you wish, if at the end of the year
you can guess, and if you tell me with what the devil makes his
chalice; and if you do not guess it then your soul shall be for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When our man has got his money, he goes off home without thinking at
all of the future. He lived happily for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>some time with his wife
and child; but as the time approached he grew sad, and said nothing to
his wife. One day he had gone a long way, wishing and trying to find
out his secret, and the night overtakes him. He stops at a cross-roads,
and hides himself. (You know that the witches come to the
cross-roads<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2967src" href="#xd26e2967" name=
"xd26e2967src">10</a> to meet together.) They come then,
&ldquo;hushta&rdquo; from one side, &ldquo;fushta&rdquo; from the
other, dancing. When they had well amused themselves like that, they
begin to tell each other the news. One says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know, then, such a man has sold his head to the
devil; certainly he will not guess with what the devil makes his
chalice. I do not know myself; tell it me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the parings of the finger-nails which Christians cut on
the Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our man with difficulty, with great difficulty, kept from showing
himself, through his joy and delight. As soon as the day appeared all
the witches went off to their homes, and our man too went off to his.
He was no more sad. He waited till the day arrived, and went to the
cross-roads. This gentleman was already there, come with a lot of
devils, thinking that he would be for hell. He asks him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what the devil makes his chalice of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, but I will try. With the parings of the
finger-nails which Christians cut on Sundays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he heard that, the devil goes off with all the others in
fire and flame to the bottom of hell. Our man went off home, and lived
a long time with his wife and daughter. If they had lived well, they
would have died well too. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=

<h3 class="main">The Changeling.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a gentleman
and lady. They were very well off, but they could not keep any of their
children. They had had ever so many, and all died. The lady was again
in a hopeful condition. At the beginning of the night she was confined
of a fine boy.</p>
<p>Two young men heard this news, and they said to each other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have a feast; we must steal a sheep out of this
house. They will not pay attention to us with all their bustle and
their joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the lads then goes after eleven o&rsquo;clock towards the
house. He meets an old woman, who said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you off to, lad? There is nothing like the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going, then, to such a house; the lady has been
confined, and I wish to take advantage of it to steal a sheep. They
will not pay any attention to-day. And you, where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I too am going to the house. I am a witch, and it is I who
have killed all their children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily. When the infant sneezes nobody says, &lsquo;Domine
stekan,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3005src" href="#xd26e3005"
name="xd26e3005src">11</a> and then I become mistress of the
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witch enters, doubtless as she liked, much more easily than our
lad; but nevertheless he got in himself too. He was busy choosing his
sheep, when he hears the infant sneeze. He says very, very loudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Domine stekan; even if I should not get my sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go to see who is there, and what he was saying. The lad relates
what the old woman had told him. As you may imagine they thanked him
well, and told him to choose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=
"#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>the finest sheep. The father and
mother were delighted that they would save this child; but, poor
wretches, they had not seen everything. A devil had come, who took
their child and carried it to the roadside, and left it there. A
coachman passing by sees this child, and takes it with him. He was
married, but had no children. They had a great desire to have one. They
were very well off also. His wife was delighted to see this fine child;
they gave it a good nurse, and the child grew fast and became
wonderfully handsome. The devil had placed himself in the child&rsquo;s
cradle. This mother gave him suck, and, contrary to the other, he did
not grow at all. The parents were vexed at having such a child; they
did not know what to think of it. Their true child was more than
extraordinarily clever. The coachman and his wife were dazed with joy,
and they loved him as (if he were) their own child. When he was twelve
years old, he said to his father and mother that he wished to become a
monk. The coachman and his wife were very sorry, and they asked him to
become only a priest. But after having seen his great desire they allow
him to do as he wished.</p>
<p>He went away then, and at the age of eighteen years he was able to
say mass. When he was there, one day two men were passing in front of
the garden of his <i>real</i> father, and they began to quarrel. They
got so enraged that one killed the other, and threw him into his
father&rsquo;s garden. This father was tried and condemned to death for
having killed this man.</p>
<p>While this young monk was saying mass, there comes to him a white
pigeon and tells him what was taking place in his father&rsquo;s house,
and that the pigeon will assume the form of the monk, &ldquo;and you
shall go off in my shape.&rdquo; The monk willingly does what he tells
him, and arrives when they are leading his father to execution. He was
being followed by the judges and by a crowd of people. He asks what he
has done. They tell him that he has killed a man. He asks if they would
do him a favour before they put him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75"
href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>to death&mdash;if they would
accompany him to the grave of the man whom he has killed. They tell
him, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all go off then. The monk has the grave opened, restores him to
life, and asks him, pointing to his father:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the man who has killed you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dead man says to him, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having said that he dies again. The monk did not wish to know
who had killed him; he knew all he wanted with that. The father wished
to take the monk home with him to dinner, but he would not go that day.
He said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come on such a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you may fancy they made a splendid dinner; nothing was wanting
there. They invited all their friends and acquaintances to rejoice with
them. When the monk arrives, the lady, before sitting down to table,
wished to show him her child, how she had suckled him with her own milk
eighteen years, and that he did not grow at all, but was always just as
he was when he was born. The monk betook himself to prayer, and he saw
that which they believed to be a child fly away under the shape of a
devil in fire and flame, and he carried off with him part of the house.
He told his mother not to vex herself because she had had the devil
there, and that she would be happier without such a child.</p>
<p>All the world was astonished at the power of this monk; but the
mother was still grieved. The monk, to console her, told her his
history; how he was her true child; how the devil had taken him and
carried him to the roadside; how he had been found and brought up by a
coachman; and that it was he himself who had been made priest, and her
son. All were astounded at his words. After they had well dined, the
monk went back into his convent, and the father and mother lived
honourably, as they did before; and as they lived well, they died well
too.</p>

<h2 class="main">VI.&mdash;Contes des F&eacute;es.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Under this head, we include all those legends which do
not readily fall under our other denominations. F&eacute;e and fairy
are not synonymous. All such tales as those of the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights&rdquo; might come within the designation of Contes des
F&eacute;es, but they could hardly be included under Fairy Tales,
though the former may be said to embrace the latter. We have divided
our legends of this kind into two sections:&mdash;(A) Those which have
a greater or less similarity to Keltic legends, as recorded in
Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tales of the West Highlands,&rdquo; and
elsewhere; (B) Those which we believe to be derived directly from the
French.</p>
<p>We have chosen the designation Keltic, because the burning question
concerning the Basques at present is their relation to the Keltic race.
Anything that can throw light upon this will have a certain interest
for a small portion of the scientific world. That these legends do in
some degree resemble the Keltic ones will, we think, be denied by no
one. Whether they have a closer affinity with them than with the
general run of Indo-European mythology may be an open question. Or,
again, whether the Basques have borrowed from the Kelts, or the Kelts
from the Basques, we leave undetermined. One legend here given, that of
&ldquo;Juan Dekos,&rdquo; has clearly been borrowed from the Gaelic,
and that since the Keltic occupation of the Hebrides.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3057src" href="#xd26e3057" name="xd26e3057src">1</a> The very
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>term Keltiberi, as used by the classical writers,
shows some contact of the Kelts with the Basques in ancient times,
whether we take Basque and Iberi to be co-extensive and convertible
terms or not. What the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the &ldquo;White
Mare&rdquo; is in these tales we do not understand. Can it be connected
with the figure of a horse which appears so frequently on the so-called
Keltiberian coins, or is it a mere variation of the Sanscrit
&ldquo;Harits, or horses of the sun?&rdquo; Campbell, Vol. I., p. 63,
says these &ldquo;were always feminine, as the horses in Gaelic stories
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be, perhaps, as well to mention that we did not see
Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tales of the West Highlands&rdquo; till after
these legends had been written down.</p>

<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a man and a
woman who were over-burdened with children, and were very poor. The man
used to go to the forest every day to get wood for his family. His wife
was on the point of being confined. One day he was in the forest, and a
gentleman comes to him, and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking for wood to support my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very poor, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will make me godfather to your next child according to
your law, I will give you a great deal of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to him, &ldquo;Yes, I will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives him, then, a great deal of money, and he goes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>home.
His wife is confined shortly afterwards, and they were waiting, not
knowing what to do to tell it to the godfather, since they did not know
where he lived. He himself appeared from somewhere. They go to the
church, and he gives him the name Malbrouk. While they were returning
to the house, the godfather disappears with the child like smoke. The
father and mother were distressed about it, though they had plenty of
money; but in time their grief faded away.</p>
<p>The old Malbrouk went to his house. His wife was a witch, and they
had three daughters. The little Malbrouk grew fast, and at seven
years&rsquo; old he was as tall as a tall man. His godfather said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malbrouk, would you like to go to your own home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said to him, &ldquo;Am I not here in my own home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told him, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and that he might go there for three
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to such a mountain, and the first house that you will see
there will be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes, then, to the mountain, and sees the house, and goes to it.
He finds his two brothers at the door cutting wood. He tells them that
he is their brother; but they will not believe him. They take him
indoors, and he tells his father and mother that he is Malbrouk. They
are astonished to see such a big man for seven years&rsquo; old. They
pass these three days in great delight; and he said to his
brothers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is plenty of room at my godfather&rsquo;s for you too,
and you must come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go off, then, all three together. When they arrive, the witch
was not at all contented. She said to her husband:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. These three men will do us some mischief,
and we must kill them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malbrouk did not wish to; but as the witch gave him no rest, he told
her that at the end of three days he would kill them. What does the
little Malbrouk do? At night their daughters used to put crowns on
their heads, and the little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>Malbrouk and his brothers cotton
night-caps. The little Malbrouk says to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make an exchange; it is now our turn to have the
crowns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were just as well pleased, and they gave them to them. One
night (old) Malbrouk goes there, and after having felt their heads,
when he perceived that they had the night-caps, he kills the three.
After the little Malbrouk saw that he woke his brothers, took his
godfather&rsquo;s seven-leagued boots, and goes off, far, far, far
away. The witch said to (the old Malbrouk):</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have taken good care whom you have killed? I am not at
all satisfied that you have not done some donkey-trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witch goes, and sees her three daughters dead. She was terribly
angry,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3131src" href="#xd26e3131" name=
"xd26e3131src">3</a> and there was no help for it.</p>
<p>Malbrouk and his brothers come to a place where a king lives, and he
remarks that everything is sad. He asks what it is? They tell him that
the king has lost his three daughters, and that nobody can find them.
Malbrouk says to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They tell that quickly to the king, and bring them before him, and
Malbrouk tells him, too, that he will find them. All three set out.
When they have gone a little way they find an old woman, who says to
them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to in that fashion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To look for the king&rsquo;s three daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This old woman says to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the king, and ask him for three hundred fathoms of new
rope, a bucket, and a bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go, and the king gives to them immediately what they ask for.
They go, then, to the woman, and she says to them, pointing to a well,
that they are in that well.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3153src" href=
"#xd26e3153" name="xd26e3153src">4</a> The eldest put himself into the
bucket, and says to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I am afraid, I will ring the bell.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he has gone only a little way he is frightened, and rings. They
pull him up. The second goes; and when he has gone a little farther
down he is frightened, and rings. Malbrouk then gets in, and he says to
them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I shall give a pull at the bucket from below, then you
will pull it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes down, then, and at last he sees that there is a beautiful
house underground, and he sees there a beautiful young lady, who is
sitting with a serpent asleep in her lap. When she sees Malbrouk, she
says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off, I pray you, from here; he has only three-quarters of
an hour to sleep, and if he wakes, it is all over with you and
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to her, &ldquo;No matter; lay the head of the serpent on the
ground, gently, gently, without waking him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lays it there, and he carries off this young lady in the bucket,
after having pulled the cord. He goes into another chamber, and he sees
another young lady, still more beautiful, with the head of a lion
asleep on her lap. She also says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off quickly from here. He has only half-an-hour to sleep,
and if he wakes, it is all up with you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malbrouk says to her, &ldquo;Place gently, gently, without waking
him, the head of the lion on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She does so. Malbrouk takes her, gets into the bucket with her, and
his brothers pull them both up. They write at once to the king to come
and fetch them, that they have found two of his daughters. As you may
suppose, the king sends a carriage directly to fetch them, and he makes
great rejoicings. The king tells him to choose whichever of the two he
likes for his wife. Malbrouk says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I shall have found your third daughter she shall be my
wife, and my two brothers may take these two young ladies for their
wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They do as Malbrouk said, and he sets out to see his sweetheart. He
goes on, and on, and on. All the fowls of the air know Malbrouk. As he
was going along he finds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>a wolf, a dog, a hawk, and an ant,
and in their language they cry out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oyhu!<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3188src" href="#xd26e3188"
name="xd26e3188src">5</a> Malbrouk, Malbrouk!&rdquo; and saying to him,
&ldquo;Where are you going, Malbrouk? these three days we have been
here before this sheep, and cannot agree how to divide it; but you, you
shall divide it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malbrouk goes to them, then, trembling lest they should make a
division of him, too. He cuts off the head, and gives it to the
ant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have enough to eat, and for your whole
household.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives the entrails to the hawk, and for the dog and the wolf he
cuts the carcase in half. He left them all well satisfied; and Malbrouk
goes on his way in silence, in silence. When he had gone a little way,
the ant says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not given Malbrouk any reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolf calls to him to come back. Malbrouk comes trembling,
thinking that it was his turn, and that they are going to eat him,
without doubt. The ant says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not given you anything, after that you have made such
a good division for us; but whenever you wish to become an ant, you
have only to say, &lsquo;Jesus, ant!&rsquo; and you will become an
ant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hawk says to him: &ldquo;When you wish to make yourself a hawk,
you will say, &lsquo;Jesus, hawk!&rsquo; and you will be a
hawk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wolf says to him: &ldquo;When you shall wish to become a wolf,
you shall say, &lsquo;Jesus, wolf!&rsquo; and you shall be a
wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the dog, he said to him the same thing, too.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3213src" href="#xd26e3213" name="xd26e3213src">6</a> He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>goes off, then, well pleased, further into the
forest. A woodpecker says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malbrouk, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To fetch such a daughter of a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not find her easily. Since they have delivered her
sisters, he has carried her to the farther side of the Red
Sea,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3237src" href="#xd26e3237" name=
"xd26e3237src">7</a> in an island, and keeps her there in prison, in a
beautiful house, with the doors and windows so closely shut that only
the ants can get into that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malbrouk goes off happy at hearing this news, and that he would find
the princess. He goes on, and on, and on, and he arrives opposite to
this island, and remembering what the hawk had said to him, he said,
&ldquo;Jesus, hawk!&rdquo; and immediately he becomes a hawk.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3244src" href="#xd26e3244" name="xd26e3244src">8</a>
He flies away, and goes on until he comes to the island of which the
woodpecker had told him; he sees that he can only get in there like an
ant, and he says, &ldquo;Jesus, ant!&rdquo; and he gets through the
little lattice-work. He is dazed at the sight of the beauty of this
young lady. He says, &ldquo;Jesus, man!&rdquo; and he becomes a man
again. When the young lady sees him, she says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off quickly from here. It is all over with your life. He
is about to come, this horrible body without a soul,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3249src" href="#xd26e3249" name="xd26e3249src">9</a> before a
quarter of an hour, and you will be done away with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will become an ant again, and I will place myself in your
bosom; but do not scratch yourself too hard, else you will crush
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he has said that the monster comes. He <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>gives
her partridges and pigeons for her dinner, but he himself eats serpents
and horrible vermin. He tells her that he has a slight headache, and to
take the hammer and rap him on the head. She could not lift it, it was
so big; but she knocks him as well as she is able. The monster goes
off. The ant comes out from where he was, and prepares to eat the
partridges and pigeons with the young lady. Malbrouk said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must ask him, as if you were in great trouble about it,
what would have to be done to kill him? and you will tell him how
unhappy you would be if he should be killed&mdash;that you would die of
hunger in prison in this island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady says, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she will do so.</p>
<p>The monster comes again, and says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! ay! ay! my head. Take the hammer, and hit me
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady does it until she is tired, and then she says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unfortunate I shall be if you die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answers, &ldquo;I shall not die. He who will know that will know
a great secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly I would not wish you to die. I should die of
hunger in this island without you, and I should get no benefit by it.
You ought to tell me what would kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to her, &ldquo;No! Before this, too, a woman has deceived a
man, and I will not tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell it to me&mdash;yes, to me. To whom shall I tell
it? I see nobody. Nobody is able to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, at last, he tells her then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must kill a terrible wolf which is in the forest, and
inside him is a fox, in the fox is a pigeon; this pigeon has an egg in
his head, and whoever should strike me on the forehead with this egg
would kill me.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3283src" href="#xd26e3283"
name="xd26e3283src">10</a> But who will know all that? Nobody.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>The princess said to him, &ldquo;Nobody, happily. I, too, I should
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monster goes out as before, and the ant too, as you may think,
happy in knowing the secret. On the very next day he sets out for the
forest. He sees a frightful wolf. He says, directly, &ldquo;Jesus,
wolf!&rdquo; and he immediately becomes a wolf. He then goes to this
wolf, and they begin to fight, and he gets him down and chokes him. He
leaves him there, and goes off to the young lady in the island, and
says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got the wolf; I have killed him, and left him in the
forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monster comes directly afterwards, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! ay! ay! my head! Strike my head quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hits his head till she is tired. He says to the princess:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have killed the wolf; I do not know if anything is going
to happen to me. I am much afraid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have nothing to be afraid of. To whom could I have told
anything? Nobody can get in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he has gone, the ant goes to the forest. He opens the wolf, and
out of him comes a fox, who escapes at full speed. Malbrouk says,
&ldquo;Jesus, dog!&rdquo; and he becomes a dog. He, too, sets off
running, and catches the fox. They begin to fight, and he kills him,
too. He opens him, and there comes out of him a pigeon. Malbrouk says,
at once, &ldquo;Jesus, hawk!&rdquo; and he becomes a hawk. He flies off
to catch the pigeon, seizes him in his terrible talons, and takes out
of his head this precious egg, and goes proudly with it into the
chamber of the young lady. He tells how he has very happily
accomplished his business, and says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present, it is your turn; act alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again he makes himself an ant. Our monster comes, crying, that
it is all up with him, that they have taken the egg out of the pigeon,
and that he does not know what must become of him. He tells her to
strike him on the head with the hammer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>The young lady says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to fear? Who shall have got this egg? And how
should he strike your forehead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shows her how, saying, &ldquo;Like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the young lady had the egg in her hand, she strikes the monster
as he had told her, and he falls stark dead. In an instant the ant
comes out joyously (from his hiding-place), and he says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must set out instantly for your father&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They open a window, and the young man makes himself a hawk, and he
says to the young lady:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cling firmly to my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he flies off, and they arrive at the other side of the island.
He writes immediately to the king his lord, to send and fetch them as
quickly as possible. The king sent; and judge what joy and what feasts
there were in that court. The king wished them to marry directly, but
Malbrouk would not do so. (He said) that he ought to bring his dowry.
The king said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have gained enough already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He will not hear of that, but goes off far, far, far away, to the
house of his godfather.</p>
<p>They had there a cow with golden horns, and these horns bore fruits
of diamonds. A boy used to guard her in the field. Malbrouk said to
him:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3336src" href="#xd26e3336" name=
"xd26e3336src">11</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;What! do you not hear that the master is calling you? Go,
quickly, then, and learn what he wants of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, (believing it), goes off. The master calls to him from the
window:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to, leaving the cow? Go quickly; I see
that Malbrouk is about there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy sets off running back, but he cannot find the cow. Malbrouk
had got off proudly with his cow, and he gives it to his future wife,
who was very much pleased with it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86"
href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>The king wished him, then, to
marry, (saying) that he was quite rich enough. Malbrouk would not yet.
He must make a present to the king. He goes again to his
godfather&rsquo;s house. He wished to steal from him a moon, which
lighted for seven leagues round. Old Malbrouk used to drink a barrel of
water every night. Young Malbrouk goes and empties this barrel. When
night came, Malbrouk goes to drink at his barrel, and finds it empty.
He goes to find his wife, and says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not got a drop of water; go directly, and fetch me
some. I cannot bear this thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife said to him, &ldquo;It is night, light your moon.&rdquo; He
lights it, and puts it by the chimney, on the roof. When everyone has
gone to the fountain, young Malbrouk goes and takes this moon, and
carries it to the king. And he, astonished, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you have done grandly; now be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he would not; (he said) that he ought to bring something more.
His godfather had a violin, which it was enough only to touch for it to
play, no matter what beautiful music, and it would be heard seven
leagues off. He goes into his godfather&rsquo;s house to take the
violin, and as soon as he has touched it, it begins to play music. Old
Malbrouk rushes off, and catches his godson in the act. He seizes him,
and puts him into an iron cage. He and his wife are right well pleased.
They say to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This evening we are going to roast you, and eat
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Malbrouk goes to the forest to fetch wood, and his wife was busy
cutting some small&mdash;she was taking a great deal of trouble about
it. Malbrouk says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get out of here; I will cut that wood for you. You can
kill me all the same this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lets him out. After having cut up some, he takes one of the
largest pieces and strikes the wife of Malbrouk, and kills her. He
makes a great fire, and puts her in the caldron to boil. He takes the
violin, and leaves the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"
name="pb87">87</a>]</span>house. When old Malbrouk hears the violin, he
says to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife, not being able to hold out any longer, has,
doubtless, killed Malbrouk, and to show me her joy she has taken the
violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he does not trouble himself any more about it. When he
approaches the house he stands, well pleased, looking at the caldron on
the fire, but, on coming nearer, he sees some long hairs. He pulls out
a little more, and perceives that it is his wife, who is there already,
half-boiled. Think what a rage he was in. The young Malbrouk went to
the king&rsquo;s house, and married his well-beloved princess. They
made great rejoicings. As the king was somewhat aged, he gives his
crown to Malbrouk, saying that he had well gained it. They all lived
happily, and he made his two brothers kings also.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">The Fisherman and His Sons.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a fisherman
who lived with his wife. One day he was fishing and caught a fine fish
(at that time all the animals and everything used to speak), and the
fish said to him:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3383src" href="#xd26e3383"
name="xd26e3383src">12</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare my life! Spare my life! I will give you all that you
shall desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this poor man spared its life, and went home without having
caught anything else. When he came home his wife asks him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your fish?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>He tells her how that he had caught a fish, and that it had begged
him to spare its life, and that he had left it in the water. His wife
says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost your head then? After having caught a fish to
put it back again into the water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she called him all sorts of names, even &ldquo;big
donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day he goes fishing again, and (what a chance!) the same
fish came again. It asks him again to spare its life. But the man
answers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! My wife loaded me with abuse last evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fish said to him that he would give him as much money as he
wished if he would but spare him. And our fisherman lets him go again.
He remains there again all day, but nothing comes to his hook. Again he
goes off home without anything at all. His wife is furious at seeing
that he has nothing. He gives her some money, but she was not
satisfied, and told her husband that he ought to have brought the
fish.</p>
<p>He goes fishing again for the third time, and again the same fish
returns, and says to him, &ldquo;Let me go into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But our man will not let him go again; his wife had scolded him so
much last night. He must carry him home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, since you will carry me home, I will tell you how
you must divide me. You must give my tail to the dog, my head to the
mare, and my trunk to your wife. At the end of a certain time your wife
will bear three sons, and they will all be exactly like each other,
exactly alike. The mare will have three colts, but all three alike, and
the bitch three puppies, all exactly alike too. And if any misfortune
should happen to any of the three children, the well which is behind
the house will begin to boil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman did as the fish had said, and she gave birth to three
wonderfully fine boys, who were all exactly, exactly alike, and the
mare had three colts exactly alike, and the bitch three puppies exactly
alike too. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>When these children grew big, one of them said to his parents that
he wished to go from country to country to see the world. His parents
did not wish it. But he had such a desire that at last they gave him
leave. He takes a horse and a dog, extraordinarily large and handsome,
a sword also,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3426src" href="#xd26e3426"
name="xd26e3426src">13</a> and off he starts. He goes on, and on, very,
very far. He comes to a city and goes to an inn. They were lamenting
loudly there, and everybody was sad.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3429src" href="#xd26e3429" name="xd26e3429src">14</a> He asks,
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; They tell him how that a serpent with seven
heads lived in the mountain, and that every day they drew lots to know
who should go to him, because he must eat one person every day; and
that to-day the lot has fallen on the king&rsquo;s daughter, and that
everyone was in mourning, and that the next day this princess must go
very early to the mountain.</p>
<p>Our young man takes his horse, his dog, and his sword, and starts
off before the princess. He keeps himself hidden until the princess was
alone at the top. Then our lad comes out, and the princess says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from here? Go down quickly, else you will
be eaten as well as I. It is quite enough for one (to die).&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she entreats him to go down, but our lad will not. He wishes to
try if he can do anything. At the same moment they hear a shrill
hissing, and with that the serpent comes. The lad says to the dog:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the dog leaps upon the serpent and holds him. He takes his sword
and cuts off his seven heads as best he can. When he has done that he
takes the seven tongues out of the seven heads and puts them in his
pocket. This princess had on seven robes, each more beautiful than the
others, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>and he cuts seven pieces out of them severally.
The princess does not know what to do to thank him. She wishes to take
the lad home with her, but he will not go. And he returns to the
inn.</p>
<p>The king proclaims that the man who has killed the serpent has
gained the half of his kingdom, and his daughter; that he should make
himself known. Our lad does not show himself at all, but a
charcoal-burner<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3452src" href="#xd26e3452"
name="xd26e3452src">15</a> passing by on the mountain found the seven
heads. He presents himself before the king as if he had killed the
serpent. But the princess does not recognise him, and says that it is
not he who has saved her. But as no one else came the marriage was
about to be celebrated, when the princess pointed out to her father
from a distance her rescuer. The king would not believe her. But they
send and fetch him, and tell the charcoal-burner to show the seven
heads of the serpent, and he shows them with great boldness. Our young
man tells him to open their mouths. He does so, and the mouths had no
tongues. Then he who had killed the serpent shows the seven tongues,
and the seven pieces of the princess&rsquo; robes, and they were all
convinced that he had killed the serpent; and they burned the
charcoal-burner alive in the middle of the market-place.</p>
<p>Our young man marries the princess, and they had many and great
rejoicings because he had delivered all the world from the terrible
serpent. In the evening, when they retired to their chamber, the wife
knelt down to say her prayers, and the husband went and looked out of
the window, and he saw by the moonlight a magnificent castle,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3458src" href="#xd26e3458" name=
"xd26e3458src">16</a> which he had never seen before.</p>
<p>He asks his wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife says to him: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody goes to that castle, for they who go there never
return.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3470src" href="#xd26e3470"
name="xd26e3470src">17</a></p>
<p>The husband said to her that he must go there. His wife did not wish
it, but he had such a desire to do so that he takes his horse, his dog,
and his sword, and goes off. He looks round and round (the castle), but
he cannot find the door. At last he finds a little door half hidden,
very small. He knocks. An old woman comes to him, and asks him what he
wants.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;I have seen this castle so beautiful outside, that I
am anxious to see the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shows him in. He sees a table splendidly laid out. There was
nothing that there was not on the table. This woman invites him to take
something. He says that he does not want anything, but she insists so
much that he ends by taking something. As soon as he has eaten the
first mouthful he becomes a terrible monster, and by no means could he
get out of that house.</p>
<p><i>The water begins to boil at home</i>, as the fish had said. All
those in the house are grieved because some misfortune has happened to
the son. One of the brothers at home said that he would immediately set
out to the help of his brother. Those at home are very sorry, but they
let him go. He takes a horse and a dog. The father and mother give him
all the money that they can give him, and he starts off. He goes on,
and on, and on, and, as was fated,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3483src"
href="#xd26e3483" name="xd26e3483src">18</a> he comes to the same inn
as his brother. There they recognise him. They inform the king that the
gentleman is at the house, because he had had a search made for him
through all the neighbourhood. They come and fetch him out of his
corner, and he lets them do as they wish. A great supper was made, and
he goes off with the princess. As before, the princess knelt down to
pray. The young man goes to look out of the window, and sees this
palace. He asks her what this beautiful castle is. She says to him:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know what takes place there! They who go there
never return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says that he will start off directly. His wife asks him if he
will return to that castle as before. &ldquo;Do not go, I pray
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But nothing could have stopped him, and off he goes with his horse
and his dog. Like the other brother, he goes wandering round and round
the house without finding the door. At last he sees a very little door
half hidden. He knocks at it, and the old woman comes and says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the outside of this castle, and I wish to see the
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tells him to come in. He leaves his horse and his dog outside,
and he sees a table splendidly set out; one could not mention anything
that was wanting, there was something of everything. She tells him to
eat something. He did not wish to, but at last he takes something, (so
little, that it was) almost nothing. At the first mouthful he becomes a
terrible monster, and cannot in any way get out.</p>
<p><i>The water at home begins to boil</i>, and they know that some
misfortune has happened to him.</p>
<p>The third brother said that he must set out as quickly as possible.
The parents did not wish it, but he said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shall save them; let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They give him as much money as they can. He takes a horse and a dog,
and off he starts. He goes on, and on, and on. He also goes to the same
inn as his other brothers. He is recognised immediately, and the king
is informed that this young gentleman is there. He sends to fetch him
immediately, and makes great feastings and rejoicings, thinking that it
is always the same as their first young gentleman. In the evening he is
conducted to the princess. The princess kneels down to say her evening
prayers, and her husband, wishing to see a little more of the festival,
placed himself at the window. He also sees the beautiful castle. He
asks his wife: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this beautiful house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She says to him, &ldquo;What! You! Do not <i>you</i> know what it
is? No one returns from there. You know yourself what happens there,
since you have been there yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said to her, &ldquo;I must go and see it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess would not let him go; but he broke away from her. He
takes his horse and his dog, and starts off. He looks, and looks all
round, and cannot find the door. An old woman appears to him, and says
to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think will become of you here? They who go in
there do not come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is why I wish to go in, to know what passes
within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old woman gives him a pigeon, cooked and prepared for
eating, and said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside there is an old woman. She will try and force you to
eat; but, if you are wise, you will not eat. You will show her the
pigeon that you have in your pocket which remains after your repast,
and you must make her eat some of the pigeon, and you will have full
power over her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he has found the door, he knocks. This old woman comes, and
asks him what he wants. He says that he only wishes to see this house.
She lets him in. He takes his dog, also, with him. He sees this
splendid table. She wishes absolutely to make him eat; but he says that
it is altogether impossible&mdash;that he has in his pocket a pigeon
which he has not been able to eat, and that she must eat some of that.
The old woman says she will not. He compels her, and tells her she
must; and at last she eats it. He then asks her what she has done with
his brothers. She says that she knows nothing about them; that she does
not know what he means. He forces her to tell him, and says to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make my dog strangle you if you do not tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He frightens her so, that she shows him some terrible <span class=

"pb94">94</a>]</span>monsters. He tells her to restore them as they
were before, otherwise some misfortune shall happen to her, and to mind
what she is about. At last she set to work to change them as they were
before, and their horses and dogs as well.</p>
<p>They all go to the king&rsquo;s palace, where everyone is immensely
astonished to see three gentlemen arrive exactly alike in all respects.
They ask the princess which is her husband. But the poor young lady is
greatly embarrassed. She could not distinguish them, because they were
exactly alike. At last he who had killed the serpent said that he was
her husband. They make great rejoicings, and give a great deal of money
to the two brothers, and to their parents, and they went off. They
burnt the old woman in the midst of the market-place, and this handsome
castle was given to the newly-married pair, and they lived happily at
court; and, as they lived well, so they died happily.</p>

<p>All the <i>latter</i> part of this tale is much more detailed than
in the Gaelic, and it is singular to read this note from
Campbell&rsquo;s collector:&mdash;&ldquo;The Gaelic is given as nearly
as possible in the words used by Mackenzie; but he thinks his story
rather shortened.&rdquo; Of the identity of the two stories there can
be no doubt, although each supplies what is wanting to the other.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a lad who
wished to travel, and off he went. He finds a snuff-box, and opens it.
And the snuff-box said to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="es">Que quieres?</span>&rdquo; (&ldquo;What do
you wish for?&rdquo;) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95"
name="pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p>He is frightened, and puts it at once into his pocket. Luckily he
did not throw it away. He goes on, and on, and on, and at last he said
to himself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;(I wonder) if it would say to me again, &lsquo;<span lang=
"es">Que quieres?</span>&rsquo; I should well know what to
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He takes it out again, and opens it, and it says to him again,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="es">Que quieres?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad says to it, &ldquo;My hat full of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it is filled!</p>
<p>He is astounded, and he said to himself that he would never want
anything any more. He goes on, and on, and on; and, after he had passed
some forests, he arrives at a fine castle. The king lived there. He
goes round, and round, and round it, looking at it with an impudent
air. The king says to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see your castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would wish, too, to have one like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad does not answer. When the evening came, our lad takes out
his snuff-box, and it said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="es">Que quieres?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Build here, on this very spot, a castle, with laths of gold
and silver, and diamond tiles, and with all its furniture of gold and
silver.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3608src" href="#xd26e3608"
name="xd26e3608src">20</a></p>
<p>As soon as he has said it, he sees in front of the king&rsquo;s
castle a castle like what he had asked for. When the king gets up in
the morning, he was astonished at this dazzling castle. His eyes were
blinded by the (reflection of the) rays of the sun which fell upon it.
The king went and said to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be a man of great power,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3617src" href="#xd26e3617" name="xd26e3617src">21</a> and you
must come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>to our house, where we will live together. I have
a daughter, too, and you shall marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They do as the king had said, and they lived all together in the
dazzling house. He was married to the king&rsquo;s daughter, and lived
happily.</p>
<p>Now, the king&rsquo;s wife was very envious of the lad and of his
wife. She knew, by her daughter, how that they had a snuff-box, and
that it did all that they wished. She intrigued with one of the
servants to try and take it from them; but they take great care (to
conceal) where they put the snuff-box away every evening. Nevertheless,
at last she sees where it is put, and in the middle of the night, while
they slept, she takes it from them, and carries it to her old mistress.
What a joy for her!</p>
<p>She opens it, and the snuff-box says to her, &ldquo;<span lang=
"es">Que quieres?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take myself and my husband, and my servants, and
this beautiful house, to the other side of the Red Sea,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3633src" href="#xd26e3633" name=
"xd26e3633src">22</a> and leave my daughter and her husband
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young couple awoke in the morning, they found themselves in
the old castle, and their snuff-box was gone. They look for it
everywhere, but it is useless.</p>
<p>The young man will not wait an instant longer at home. He must start
off at once to find his castle and his snuff-box. He takes a horse, and
as much gold as the horse can carry, and he goes on, and on, and on,
and on. He searches through all the towns in the neighbourhood until he
had finished all his money. He searched, but he did not find it
anywhere. But he went looking out still, feeding his horse as best he
could, and begging for himself. Some one told him that he ought to go
to the moon&mdash;that he makes a very long journey, and that he might
guide him. He goes far, far, far away, on, and on, and on, and at last
he arrives. He finds an old woman, who says to him&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you come to do here? My son devours all creatures of
all sorts; and, if you will trust me, you will be off before his
arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells her his misfortunes&mdash;how that he had a snuff-box of
great power, which has been stolen from him, and that he is now without
anything, far from his wife, and stripped of everything, &ldquo;and
perhaps your son, in his journeys, has seen my palace, with its golden
laths and tiles of diamonds, and the other ornaments of gold and
silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the moon appeared, and said to his mother that he
smelt some one. His mother told him how that there was a wretched man
who had lost everything; that he was come to him (for help), and that
he would guide him. The moon told him to show himself. He comes, and
asks him if he has not seen a house with beams of gold and with tiles
of diamonds, and the rest of gold and silver; and he tells him how it
was taken away from him.</p>
<p>He answers, &ldquo;No;&rdquo; that he has not seen it, but that the
sun makes longer journeys than he, and of greater extent, and that he
would do better to go to him.</p>
<p>He goes off again, on, and on, and on, with his horse, whom he
nourished as he could, and begging for himself. At length he arrives at
the sun&rsquo;s house. He finds an old woman, who said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from? Be off from here! Do you not know
that my son eats all Christians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said to her, &ldquo;No! I will not go away. I am so wretched that
I do not care if he does eat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he tells her how he has lost everything; that he had a house,
which had not its equal, with beams of gold and tiles of diamonds, and
all the ornaments of gold and precious stones; and that he had been
going about looking for it so long a time, and that there was no man so
wretched as he. This woman hides him. The sun comes out and says to his
mother&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell the smell of a Christian, and I must eat him.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>The mother tells him that it was an unfortunate man who had lost his
all, that he had come to speak to him, and begs him to take pity on
him. He tells her to bring him out. Then the young man comes and asks
the sun if he has seen a palace which has its equal nowhere, with its
laths of gold and its tiles of diamonds, and the rest of gold and
silver. The sun says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but the south wind searches everything that I cannot see.
He enters into every corner, he does, and if any one ought to know he
will know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our poor man then sets off again, feeding his horse how he could and
begging for himself, and he comes at length to the house of the south
wind.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3668src" href="#xd26e3668" name=
"xd26e3668src">23</a> He finds an old woman carrying water, and who was
filling a great many barrels. She said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of to come here? My son eats up
everything when he arrives hungry and furious. You must beware of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to her, &ldquo;It is all the same to me. Let him eat me; I
am so wretched that I fear nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he tells her how he had a beautiful house which had not its
equal in all the world, and with it all sorts of riches, and that,
&ldquo;Having abandoned my wife, I am seeking it, and I am come to
consult your son, being sent by the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hides him under the staircase. The south wind arrives as if he
meant to tear the house up, and very thirsty. Before beginning to drink
he smells the smell of the race of Christians, and said to his
mother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with what you have hidden,&rdquo; and that he must begin
by eating him.</p>
<p>His mother said to him, &ldquo;Eat and drink what is before
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she tells him the misfortunes of this man, and how that the sun
has spared his life that he might come and consult him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he makes the man come out, and the man tells him how that he is
going about trying to find a house, and that if anybody ought to know
it is he, and that they had robbed him of his house, which had laths of
gold, tiles of diamonds, and all the rest of gold and silver, and if he
has not seen it anywhere?</p>
<p>He tells him, &ldquo;Yes, yes, and all to-day I have been passing
over it, and have not been able to take away one of its
tiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if you will tell me where it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says that it is on the other side of the Red Sea, very, very far
away.</p>
<p>When our man heard that, the length of the road did not frighten
him&mdash;he had already travelled over so much. He sets out then, and
at last arrives at that city. He asks if anyone is in want of a
gardener. They tell him that the gardener of the castle has gone away,
and that perhaps they will take him. He goes off, and recognises his
house&mdash;judge with what joy and delight! He asks if they are in
want of a gardener. They tell him &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and our lad is
very pleased. He passes some time tolerably happily&mdash;middling. He
talks with a servant about the riches of the masters and of the power
which they had. He flattered and cajoled this young girl very much to
get from her the history of the snuff-box, and he told her once that he
very much wished to see it. One evening she brought it to him to look
at, and our lad, very much pleased, pays great attention to where it
was hidden in the room of the mistress. At night, when everybody is
asleep, he goes and takes the snuff-box. You will understand with what
joy he opens it.</p>
<p>It says to him, &ldquo;<span lang="es">Que
quieres?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the lad says to it, &ldquo;<span lang="es">Que quieres, Que
quieres</span>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3707src" href="#xd26e3707"

servants in this Red Sea.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100"

<p>As soon as he had said it, he was carried to his wife, and they
lived happily, and the others all perished in the Red Sea.<a class=

<h4 class="main">Mahistruba, the Master Mariner.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a master
mariner. Having had many losses and misfortunes in his life he no
longer made any voyages, but every day went down to the seaside for
amusement, and every day he met a large serpent, and every day he said
to it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God has given thy life to thee; live then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This master mariner lived upon what his wife and daughter earned by
sewing. One day the serpent said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to such a shipbuilder&rsquo;s, and order a ship of so many
tons burden. Ask the price of it, and then double the price they tell
you.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3734src" href="#xd26e3734" name=
"xd26e3734src">26</a></p>
<p>He does as the serpent told him, and the next day he goes down to
the shore, and he tells the serpent that he has done as he had told
him. The serpent then bids him go and fetch twelve sailors, very strong
men, and to double whatever they shall ask. He goes and does what he
was told to do. He returns to the serpent and tells him that he has
twelve men. The serpent gives him all the money which he needed to pay
for the ship. The shipbuilder is astonished to find that he is paid so
large a sum of money in advance by this miserable man, but he hastens
to finish his work as quickly as possible. The serpent again bids him
have made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>in the hold of the ship a large empty space and
a huge chest, and tells him to bring this down himself. He brings it,
and the serpent gets into it. The ship was quickly ready, he embarks
the chest in the ship, and they set out.</p>
<p>This captain used to go every day to the serpent, but the sailors
did not know what he went (into the hold) to do, nor what there was in
the chest. The ship had already gone some distance, and nobody knew its
destination. One day the serpent told the captain that there was going
to be a frightful storm, that the earth and sky would mingle together,
and that at midnight a large black bird would pass over the ship, and
that it must be killed, and (he tells him) to go and see if there is
any sportsman among his sailors. He goes and asks the sailors if there
is any sportsman among them.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3743src" href=
"#xd26e3743" name="xd26e3743src">27</a></p>
<p>One of them answers, &ldquo;Yes; I can kill a swallow in its
flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better, all the better; that will be of use to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes down to tell the serpent that there is a sportsman who can
kill a swallow in its flight. And at the same moment the weather
becomes black as night, and earth and sky are mingled together, and all
are trembling with fright. The serpent gives the captain a good drink
for the sportsman, and they bind him to the mast. At midnight a
piercing cry was heard. It was the bird which was passing over, and our
sportsman has the good luck to kill him. At the very instant the sea
becomes calm. The captain goes to the serpent, and tells him that the
bird is killed.</p>
<p>The serpent answers him, &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had gone a little further without anything happening, the
serpent said one day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we not near such a port?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain says to him, &ldquo;It is in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, we are going there.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>He tells him to go again, and ask his sailors if there is a fast
runner among them. The captain goes and asks his sailors if there is
any fast runner among them.</p>
<p>One of them says to him, &ldquo;As for me, I can catch a hare
running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better, so much the better; that will be of use
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain goes to tell the serpent that there is one who can catch
a hare running. The serpent says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will land the runner at this port, and you will tell him
that he must go to the top of a little mountain; that there is a little
house there, and an old, old woman in it; and that there is there a
steel, a flint, and a tinder-box; and that he must bring these three
things on board one by one, making a separate journey each
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our runner goes off, and comes to this house. He sees the old woman,
with red eyes, spinning at the threshold of her door. He asks her for a
drop of water, that he has walked a long way without finding any water,
and will she give him a little drop? The old woman says to him,
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He begs her again, telling her that he does not know
the roads in the country, nor where he is going to. This old woman kept
constantly looking at the chimney-piece, and she said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to give you some, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she went to the pitcher, our runner takes the steel off the
chimney-piece, and goes off at full speed, like the lightning; but the
old woman is after him. At the very instant that he is about to leap
into the ship the old woman catches him, and snatches off a bit of his
coat, and a piece of the skin of his back with it.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3784src" href="#xd26e3784" name="xd26e3784src">28</a> The
captain goes to the serpent, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got the steel, but our man has got the skin of his
back torn off.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>He gives him a remedy, and a good drink, and tells him that the man
will be cured by to-morrow, but that he must go again next day.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;No, no; the devil may carry off this old woman, if
he likes, but I will not go there any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as he was cured next day by giving him that good drink again,
he sets off. He dresses himself in a shirt without arms, and in an old
torn pair of trousers, and goes to the old woman&rsquo;s, saying that
his ship is wrecked on the shore, that he has been wandering about for
forty-eight hours, and he begs her to let him go to the fire to light
his pipe.</p>
<p>She says, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do have pity&mdash;I am so wretched; it is only a little
favour I ask of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I was deceived yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man answered, &ldquo;All the world are not deceivers.
Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman rises to go to the fire, and as she stoops to take
it,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3808src" href="#xd26e3808" name=
"xd26e3808src">29</a> the man seizes the flint and escapes, running as
if he would break his feet. But the old woman runs as fast as our
runner; but she only catches him as he is jumping into the ship; she
tears off the shirt, and the skin of his neck and back with it, and he
falls into the ship.</p>
<p>The captain goes directly to the serpent: &ldquo;We have got the
flint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to him, &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives him the medicine and the good drink, in order that the man
may be cured by the morrow, and that he may go again. But the man says,
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; that he does not want to see that red-eyed old woman
any more. They tell him that they still want the tinder-box. The next
day they give him the good drink. That gives him courage, and the
desire to return again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>He dresses himself up as if he had been shipwrecked, and goes off
half naked. He comes to the old woman&rsquo;s, and asks for a little
bread, as he has not eaten for a long time, (and begs her) to have pity
on him&mdash;that he does not know where to go to.</p>
<p>The old woman says to him: &ldquo;Be off, where you will; you shall
get nothing at my house, and nobody shall come in here. Every day I
have enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what have you to fear from a poor man who only wants a
little bread, and who will be off immediately afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the old woman rises to go to her cupboard, and our man takes
her little tinder-box. The old woman runs after him, wishing to catch
him, but our man is ahead. She overtakes him just as he is leaping into
the ship. The old woman takes hold of the skin of his neck, and tears
it all right down to the soles of his feet. Our runner falls down, and
they do not know whether he is alive or dead; and the old woman
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I renounce him, and all those who are in this
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain goes to the serpent, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the tinder-box, but our runner is in great danger. I
do not know whether he will live; he has no skin left from his neck to
the soles of his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Console yourselves, console yourselves, he will be cured by
to-morrow. Here is the medicine and the good drink. Now, you are saved.
Go on deck, and fire seven rounds of cannon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He mounts on deck and fires the seven rounds of cannon, and returns
to the serpent, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have fired the seven rounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to him, &ldquo;Fire twelve rounds more; but do not be
afraid. The police will come here; they will handcuff you. You will be
put in prison, and you will ask, as a favour, not to be executed before
that they have visited the ship, in order to prove that there is
nothing in it to merit such a chastisement.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>The captain goes on deck, and fires the twelve rounds of cannon. As
soon as he has fired them, the magistrates and the police arrive; they
handcuff the men, the sailors, and the captain, and they put them in
prison. The sailors were not pleased; but the captain said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will soon be delivered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the captain asks to go and speak to the king. He is
brought before the king, and the king says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are condemned to be hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain says to him, &ldquo;What! because we have fired some
cannon-shots you are going to hang us!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, because for seven years we have not heard the
cannon in this city.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3857src" href=
"#xd26e3857" name="xd26e3857src">30</a> I am in mourning&mdash;I and my
people. I had an only son, and I have lost him. I cannot forget
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain says to him: &ldquo;I did not know either this news or
this order, and I beg you not to kill us before going and seeing if
there is anything in the ship which condemns us justly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king goes with his courtiers, his soldiers, and his
judges&mdash;in a word, with everybody. When he has mounted on deck,
what a surprise! The king finds his dearly-loved son, who relates to
him how he <span class="corr" id="xd26e3870" title=
"Source: has">had</span> been enchanted by an old woman, and that he
remained a serpent seven years.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3873src"
href="#xd26e3873" name="xd26e3873src">31</a> How the captain every day
went to walk by the seaside, and every day left him his life, saying to
him, &ldquo;The good God has made you too;&rdquo; and having seen the
captain&rsquo;s good heart, &ldquo;I thought he would spare me, and it
is to him that I owe my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes to the court. The men are let out of prison, and they give
the captain a large sum of money for a dowry for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>his
two daughters, and the ship for himself. To the sailors they give as
much as they like to eat and drink for all the time they wish to stop
there, and afterwards enough to live upon for the rest of their lives.
The king and his son lived happily, and as they had lived well, they
died happily also.</p>

<p class="first">A king had a son who was called Dragon. He was as
debauched as it is possible to be. All the money that he had he had
spent, and still more; not having enough, he demanded his portion from
his father. The father gives it him immediately, and he goes off,
taking with him a companion who had been a soldier, and who was very
like himself.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3894src" href="#xd26e3894"
name="xd26e3894src">32</a> Very quickly they spent all their money.
While they were travelling in a forest they see a beautiful castle.
They enter and find there a table ready set out, and a magnificent
supper prepared. They sit down to table and sup. Nobody appears as yet,
and they go up-stairs to see the house, and they find the beds all
ready, and they go to bed. They pass a very good night. The next
morning Dragon gets up and opens the shutters, and sees a dazzling
garden.</p>
<p>He goes down into the garden, still without seeing anybody; but in
passing under a fig tree, a voice says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! ay! ay! what pain you have put me to, and what suffering
you are causing me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turns on all sides and finds nothing. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? You! I do not understand it. Appear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice says to him, &ldquo;I cannot to-day; but perhaps
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>to-morrow you will see me. But in order to do
that you will have to suffer severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He promises to suffer no matter what for her. The voice says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow night they will make you suffer every kind of
torture, but you must not say anything; and if you do that, you will
see me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had spoken all this before the soldier friend, but he had heard
nothing of it.</p>
<p>They go to the house and find the dinner quite ready. Dragon would
have wished that night had already come, to know what it was he was to
see. He goes off to bed then, and after eleven o&rsquo;clock he feels
that something is coming, and his whole body is pricked all over. He
keeps quite silent, because he wished to see the voice. And when the
cock crew &ldquo;Kukuruku!&rdquo; he was released (from his torture).
He lies waiting for daybreak to go to the fig tree. Day did not appear
as soon as he would have wished it, and he goes running to the garden
and sees under the fig tree, coming out of the ground as high as her
shoulders, a young girl, and she says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night you have suffered in silence, but the next night
they will make you suffer much more. I do not know if you can bear it
without speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He promises her that he will suffer still more in order to save
her.</p>
<p>As usual, they find the table ready for dinner and for supper. He
goes off to bed. There happens to him the same thing as in the
preceding night, but they do him still more harm. Happily he lies still
without speaking. The cock crows &ldquo;Kukuruku!&rdquo; and they leave
him quiet. As soon as daylight has come he goes off to the garden, and
he sees the young lady visible as far as the knees. Dragon is delighted
to save this beautiful girl, but she says sadly to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen nothing up to this time. They will make you
suffer twice as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says that he has courage to endure anything, because <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>he
wishes to get her out of that state. When night comes, he perceives
that two are coming instead of one. One of them was lame, and he says
to him (and you know lame people and cripples are the most
cruel).<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3930src" href="#xd26e3930" name=
"xd26e3930src">33</a> He says then to the other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You have not been able to make this wretched boy speak!
I will make him speak, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cuts off his arms and then his legs, and our Dragon does not say
anything. They make him suffer a great deal, but happily the cock crows
&ldquo;Kukuruku!&rdquo; and he is delivered. He was much afraid what
would become of him without hands and without feet; but on touching
himself he feels with pleasure that all that is made right again. While
he is in bed he hears a great noise. He lies without saying anything,
being frightened, and not knowing what might happen to him, when all of
a sudden this young lady appears and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have saved me; I am very well pleased with you. But this
is not enough; we must be off from here immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the three go off together, and travel far, far, far away, and
they arrive in a city. The young lady did not think it proper to lodge
in the same hotel with them. Next morning the young lady gets up very
early, and goes in search of the landlord of the hotel, and says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman will come here to ask for me. You will tell him
that I have gone out, and if he wishes to see me he must come to the
fountain at the Four Cantons<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3943src" href=
"#xd26e3943" name="xd26e3943src">34</a>&mdash;but fasting&mdash;and he
is to wait for me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning the young gentleman goes to the hotel, and they
tell him what the young lady has said. On that very day he goes to the
fountain, taking his comrade with him, and fasting; but as the young
lady had not yet arrived, forgetting himself, he put his hand in his
pocket, and finding there a small nut, he eats it. As soon as he has
eaten it he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>falls asleep.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3953src" href="#xd26e3953" name="xd26e3953src">35</a> The young
lady arrives. She sees that he is asleep. She says to his
companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has eaten something. Tell him that I will return, but
tell, tell him, I beg you, to eat nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaves him a beautiful handkerchief. Dragon wakes up as soon as
the young lady is gone. His comrade tells him that she had come, and
that she had told him not to eat anything. And he shows Dragon the
handkerchief. He was very vexed at having eaten, and would have wished
that it was already the next day. He starts then very, very early, and
waits for the young lady, and, as was fated to happen, finding a walnut
in his pocket, he eats it. He immediately falls asleep. The young lady
appears and finds him sleeping. She says that she will return again the
next day, but that he must not eat anything. She leaves him another
handkerchief. Dragon awakes as soon as she has gone. Judge with what
vexation. His friend tells him that she said that she would return the
next day, but that he must do his best not to eat anything. He goes
then the third day without eating anything, but, as was to happen,
despairing of seeing the young lady, who was late, arrive, he takes an
apple from an apple tree and eats it. He falls asleep immediately. The
young lady comes and finds him asleep. She gives his comrade a ring to
give to Dragon, telling him that if Dragon wishes to see her he will
find her in the City of the Four Quarters. Dragon is very vexed, and he
says to his friend:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good God knows when I shall find this city, and it is
better for you to go in one direction (and I in another).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon they separate. Dragon goes off, far, far, far away. He
comes to a mountain; there he sees a man, who had before his door holy
water, and whoever made use of it was well received. He goes in,
therefore, and asks him if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href=
"#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>he knows where is the City of the
Four Quarters. He tells him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but there are the animals of the earth and of the air,
and that the latter might perhaps guide him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whistles to them. They come from all quarters, and he asks them
if they know where is the City of the Four Quarters? They tell him
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then the man says to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a brother on such a mountain, who has many more
animals than I have; he has them all under his power, that man
has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dragon goes off then, and arrives there; he asks of that man if he
knows where the City of the Four Quarters is? He tells him
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; but that he has animals which will know it, if anyone
ought to know it. He whistles to them. He sees the animals, small and
great, coming from all quarters. Dragon was trembling with fright. He
asks them one by one if they know where the City of the Four Quarters
is. They tell him &ldquo;No;&rdquo; but the man sees that one animal is
wanting, and that is the eagle. He whistles, and he comes. He asks him,
too, if he knows where the City of the Four Quarters is. He says to
him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am just come from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must, then, guide this young gentleman there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eagle says to him, &ldquo;Willingly, if he will give me a morsel
of flesh each time that I open my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dragon replies, &ldquo;Yes, willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then buys an ox. The eagle tells him to get upon his back. The
man climbs up there with his ox, and when he opens his mouth he gives
him a morsel of the ox, which kept gradually diminishing.</p>
<p>They were obliged to cross over the sea, and there was no bridge to
it there. The ox was finished when they were in the middle of the sea,
and there was a great rock there. The eagle opens his mouth again, and,
as there was no more beef, what does he do? As he was afraid of being
left <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>upon that rock, he cuts a morsel from the back
of his own thighs, and puts it in his mouth.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3995src" href="#xd26e3995" name="xd26e3995src">36</a> They arrive
on the other side of the sea. The eagle leaves him there, saying to
him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in the City of the Four Quarters. Do your own
business here. I am going off to my own home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This young gentleman asks what is the news in this city. They tell
him that the king&rsquo;s daughter is going to be married to-day. In
this city it was permitted only to the wedding party to enter the
church, but Dragon had bribed one of the keepers with money, (saying)
that he would stop quiet in a corner of the church. It was also the
custom in this city to publish the banns at the moment of marriage.
When the priest began to publish them, Dragon came out of his corner,
and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make an objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes to the young lady, who recognises him; and he shows her the
ring and the kerchiefs, and asks her in marriage. She says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shall be my husband; he has well deserved it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still lame, as a piece of his flesh was still wanting. They
were married then. The other bridegroom went back home quite ashamed.
The others lived very happily, because both had suffered much. Then I
was there, now I am here.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As there are many in the world, and as we are many of
us, there was a mother who had a son. They were very poor. The son
wished to go off somewhere, in order to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>better himself, (he
said); that it was not living to live like that. The mother was sorry;
but what could she do? In order that her son may be better off, she
lets him go. He goes then, travelling on, and on, and on. In a forest
he meets with a gentleman, who asks him where he is going. He tells him
that, wishing to better himself, he had gone away from home to do
something. This gentleman asks him if he is willing to be his servant.
He replies, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; They go off then together, and come to a
beautiful place. After having entered, the gentleman gives him all the
keys of the house, saying that he has a journey he must make, and that
he must see the whole house&mdash;that he will find in it everything he
wants to eat, and to take care of the horses in the stable. The
gentleman goes away as soon as he had seen all the house and the
stable. There were a lot of horses there, and in the midst of them all
a white mare,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4026src" href="#xd26e4026"
name="xd26e4026src">37</a> who said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! ay! Fidel, save me, I pray you, from here, and get me
outside. You will not be sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fidel stops at the place whence this voice came. A moment after, the
white mare says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come near the white mare; it is she who is speaking to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fidel goes up to her, and says to her that he cannot let her
go&mdash;that the master has not given him any other work to do (than
to take care of the horses), and that he certainly will not do any such
thing. The mare said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and fetch a saucepan, and when I shall have filled it with
water, you will wash your hands and your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fidel does as the mare told him, and is quite astonished at seeing
his hands shine, and he says to her that he does not wish to have them
like that, but that, as to his head, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>could hide
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4045src" href="#xd26e4045" name=
"xd26e4045src">38</a> The mare told him to wash his hands in the water,
and that they would become again as they were before.</p>
<p>The time goes on, and the time returns. A long time had passed, and
the master had never returned. And one day the mare said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fidel, do you know how long you have been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to her, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know at all&mdash;six months,
perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mare says to him, &ldquo;Six years have passed, and if the
master arrives when seven years shall have passed, you will be
enchanted&mdash;you, too, as we all are here&mdash;and the master is a
devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that he heard that, Fidel is frightened, and he says to
himself that it would be better to do what the white mare had
said&mdash;to get on her back, and both to escape from there. They go
off then, both of them. When they had gone some little distance, the
mare asks him if he sees anything behind him.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; that he sees something terrible, but in
the clouds; but that it is something terrific.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4061src" href="#xd26e4061" name="xd26e4061src">39</a> The mare
gives the earth a kick with her foot, and says to it,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earth, with thy power form a dense, terrible fog where he
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go on again, and the mare says again&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look back again, if you see anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fidel says to her, &ldquo;Yes, I see again this terrible thing; it
is coming after us quickly, and is going to catch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mare at the same time says again to the earth, in striking it
with her foot, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it hail stones, and hail there where he is as much as can
possibly fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go on. The mare says again,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look back, if you see anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to her again, &ldquo;He is here, this terrible monster. It
is all up with us now&mdash;we cannot escape him; he is quite near, and
he comes with speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mare strikes the earth with her foot, and says to it&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Form before him a river, and let him drown himself there for
evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sees him drown himself there. The mare says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you shall go to such a spot. The king lives there. You
will ask if they want a gardener, and they will tell you
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; You will stay there without doing anything, and the
work will do itself by itself, without your doing anything. Every day
three beautiful flowers will come up in this garden. You will carry
them to the three daughters of the king, but you will always give the
finest to the youngest.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4092src"
href="#xd26e4092" name="xd26e4092src">40</a></p>
<p>It was the custom to carry the dinner to the gardener, but it was
the youngest of the daughters who carried it to him. From the first day
the gardener pleased the young lady, and she said to him one day that
he must marry her. The lad said to her that that cannot be, that she
ought not to think of marrying with a person of low birth and who has
nothing, and that she must not dream any such dreams. This young lady
falls ill. The father sends for the doctor, who says, after having
touched her pulse, that she is ill of love; and the doctor goes to tell
it to the king. The father goes to the young lady and tells her what
the physician has said to him&mdash;that she is not so very ill. The
daughter says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to cure me you must send and fetch the gardener. Let
him give me some broth and I shall be cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father sends to fetch him directly, has him washed and properly
dressed, and makes him carry the broth. There was among the court an
old, old nurse; she was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>witch, and as she knew what the
physician had said, she goes and hides herself in the young
lady&rsquo;s bedroom before the gardener came there, in order to know
what the young lady would say to him. The young lady said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you shall marry me; I will not marry anybody else
but you, whatever you may say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad said to her: &ldquo;No, no, I will not hear that
mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse had heard all that had passed, and she goes and tells it
immediately to the king. The young lady was cured, and goes to carry
the dinner to Fidel. Fidel had a habit of always giving the first
spoonful of the soup to the dog. He gives it him that day too, and as
soon as the dog has eaten it he falls stark dead. When the young lady
saw that she goes and tells it to her father. The father sends for a
big dog, and gives him some of the soup, and as soon as he has eaten it
he falls dead. Judge of the anger of that young lady. She goes and
takes this old witch and has her burnt. She goes to look for Fidel in a
little house which was at the bottom of the garden, and she sees his
head bare.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4111src" href="#xd26e4111" name=
"xd26e4111src">41</a> It was shining like the sun, and she entirely
lost her own head for it, and she said to him, that he <i>must</i>
marry her. As she left him no peace, her father said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you <i>will</i> marry him, do so; but I will not give you
anything. You must go and live in a corner of the mountain with your
husband; there is a house there, and there you must stop. You may come
only one day a week to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all the same to this young lady, (and they are married),
and go off there. As the king had given her no money, when
Fidel&rsquo;s hair grew she went from time to time to the goldsmiths,
who said to her that they had not money enough belonging to them to pay
for the gold that she brought them. And they lived there very happily.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day Fidel heard that the king was engaged in a great war, and he
told his wife to go to her father and tell him that he too wished to go
to this war. This young lady goes to tell her father her
husband&rsquo;s commission. Her father says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of a young man like that who has never killed
anything but mole-crickets? Let him stop at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His daughter says to him: &ldquo;At least he is your
son-in-law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father then says to her: &ldquo;He may come on such a
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fidel goes as they had told him. He asks the king for a horse and a
sword. The king gives him a horse blind and lame. Fidel was not pleased
with it. He begins his march, wishing to get on as quickly as possible,
but when he had gone a little distance, the horse sticks in the mud,
and cannot in any way get out of it. While he is there, the white mare
comes to him. She gives him a beautiful horse, and a lance and a sword,
and tells him that he will see his brothers-in-law encamped round a
city, but not to stop there with them, but to ride straight to the
city; that the gates will be shut, but as soon as he shall have touched
them with his lance they will be broken to pieces, and that they will
make peace with him. He does as she told him, and starts off on his
horse like the lightning, without paying the slightest attention to his
brothers-in-law. He goes up to the city, and as soon as he has touched
the gates with his sword they are in pieces. He enters the city, and
all the world comes out and makes him a thousand <i lang=
"fr">f&ecirc;tes</i>. They declare that they wish for no more war. They
give him the key of the treasury and all the papers, and he retires
from there with all the honours. When he returns he tells his
brothers-in-law to retire&mdash;that the war is finished. They go back
again. He stops at the place where he had left his old horse in the
mud. He sends away his beautiful horse with all his things, and Fidel
stops there, not being able to drag his old horse out of the mud. When
his brothers-in-law <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>pass, they mock at him (and ask him) if it
is there that he has passed all his time. He tells them,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The others go on ahead, and at length he also
arrives at the king&rsquo;s house. He leaves his old horse there and
goes off home. He does not tell his wife what has happened, and they
live in their hole.</p>
<p>The king was getting old, and he had entirely lost his sight.
Somebody gave him to understand that there was a water which made
people young again, and another which restored sight. He told his
sons-in-law that they must go (and look for it)&mdash;that he could not
live long like that. And both of them start off. Their wives, at
starting, had given each a golden apple.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4148src" href="#xd26e4148" name="xd26e4148src">42</a> They go far
away; but they find nothing. Tired at last, they stop in a beautiful
city. They take each of them a wife, and they live according to their
fancy. When Fidel saw that his brothers-in-law did not arrive, he said
to his wife that he must go off; perhaps he might be able better to
find the waters which his father wanted. He goes off without saying
anything to the king, and travels on, and on, and on.</p>
<p>He meets an old woman, who says to him, &ldquo;Where are you going
to?&rdquo; He tells her how he wants a water which gives sight to the
blind and makes the old young,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4155src"
href="#xd26e4155" name="xd26e4155src">43</a> and that he would not go
back home without finding it. This old woman says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see two animals fighting close to you, and you will
gather the herb which makes the dead to live; you will have it boiled,
and you will keep this water for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This lad goes on a little farther, and he sees two lizards fighting
so fiercely that one kills the other. The one who was left alive takes
a blade of grass and touches the dead and rekindles his life.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4164src" href="#xd26e4164" name=
"xd26e4164src">44</a> Fidel gathers this grass, and goes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>off
to this old woman. The old woman gives him two bottles, telling him
that the one is for giving sight to the blind, and the other for making
old men young; that he must not sell these waters for money, but must
make an exchange of them for two golden apples which his
brothers-in-law have in this very city, and that it is to them that he
must give this water.</p>
<p>Fidel goes into the city, and as soon as he has entered, he
cries:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wishes to buy the water that gives sight to the blind,
and the water which makes old men young?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His two brothers-in-law appear, and say that they must have some of
this water, and ask what it costs. And he tells them that he does not
sell it, but only gives it in exchange for golden apples. These
gentlemen willingly make the exchange. But they wish to make trial of
it directly; they bring an old blind dog, and immediately he grows
young again. Judge how pleased they were with their water of power.
They set off to the king, and this water makes him become very young
and gives him sight. The king wishes to have great rejoicings, and
invites all his friends in the neighbourhood. Fidel arrives at home,
and says nothing to his wife. When he hears that the king is going to
have rejoicings, he sends his wife to ask the king if he would not like
them to go there too; that they would help, one in cutting the wood,
and the other in serving at table. She did not wish to go there at all.
She told her husband that she would a hundred times sooner stop at
home; but her husband sends her off by force, (saying) that they ought
to be there on that day. She goes, then, the poor woman, against her
wish. She asks her father if he does not want some one to help on the
feast day. The father says, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&mdash;they have servants
enough. An old general who was sitting by his side said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not let them come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king said, &ldquo;Come then on such a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fidel and his wife go. While they are at breakfast the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>old
general asks Fidel if he also does not know something to relate? He
replies &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; that he knows some (stories), but more than
one would not be pleased with what he would tell. Then the king says,
placing his sword upon the table:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point of my sword shall know news of the heart of him who
shall speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fidel begins then, how he went to the war with an old horse, blind
and lame, but that in spite of that he had carried off the keys of the
treasure and the papers. The king says to him that he has not seen them
yet&mdash;that he is still expecting them. Fidel takes out the papers
and gives them to the king. He gives also the keys of the treasury. The
king assures himself that they are the real ones. He then narrates how
he has sold in exchange for two golden apples that precious water. At
this instant his wife rises and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you these golden apples&mdash;you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it is she who has spoken the first words, Fidel takes up the
king&rsquo;s sword and strikes his wife dead.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4196src" href="#xd26e4196" name="xd26e4196src">45</a> The king
was grieved to see that, but Fidel says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not disturb yourself for that; as I have taken away her
life I will give it her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He takes out his water which rekindles dead men, and rubs some on
her temple, and she suddenly returns to life. Everyone is astounded at
this great deed, and at all that he has already done. The king tells
him that he has already gained the crown, but that he must be cured of
this terrible scab<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4206src" href=
"#xd26e4206" name="xd26e4206src">46</a> first. His wife rises, takes
off his kerchief which he had upon his head, and shows the shining head
of her husband, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, this is the scab of my husband!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king says that the crown will shine much better on his head. He
goes to fetch it, and places it upon this precious head. He banishes
his sons-in-law with his two daughters to the same desert place where
Fidel formerly lived. And Fidel and his wife lived much richer than the
king was. His precious head gave him this power; and as they lived well
they died well too.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">Laurentine.</span></p>
<p id="ch6.7">We have another version almost identical with the above,
except at the commencement. Ezkabi really has the scab. On his journey,
after leaving his home, he pays the debts of a poor man whose corpse is
being beaten in front of the church, and buries him. There is nothing
about a white mare. An old woman is the good genius of the tale. He
goes as gardener, and the king&rsquo;s daughter falls in love with him,
from catching a sight of his golden hair from her window; for the rest
the stories are identical, except that this is a shorter form than the
above.</p>

<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a mother and
her son; they were very poor. This son wished to leave his mother and
go away, (saying) that they were wretched as they were. He goes off
then far, far, far away. He finds a castle in a forest, and goes in and
asks if they want a servant, and it is a Tartaro who comes to him. He
asks him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to like that, ant of the
earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says that, being very poor at home, he wished to work to better
himself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Tartaro says to him, &ldquo;As you have told the truth I spare
your life, ant of the earth, and in a few days you will go away from
here. Three young ladies will come to bathe in the water in my garden.
They will leave their pigeon-robes under a large stone, and you will
take the pigeon&rsquo;s skin which is in the middle.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4239src" href="#xd26e4239" name="xd26e4239src">48</a> The two
young ladies will come out of the water and will take their skins. She
who stops in the water will ask you for her skin, but you shall not
give it her before she shall promise to help you always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day our lad sees that the young ladies are in the water. He
goes and does as the Tartaro tells him; he takes the middle one of the
three skins, the two young ladies take their skins, and the third asks
him to give her hers. The lad will not give it her without her promise.
The young lady will not give her word. He then says to her that he will
not give it her at all. The young lady then says to him that he may
reckon upon her, that she gives him her word, and that he shall go
to-morrow to her father&rsquo;s house, that he will take him as
servant, and that he lives in such a place. The lad goes off then the
next day and finds this beautiful house in a forest.</p>
<p>He asks if they want a servant? They tell him, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
but that there is a great deal of work to do there. The next morning
(the father) takes him into the forest and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must pull up all these oaks with their roots, you must
cut them into lengths, and put the trunks on one side, the branches on
another, and the roots by themselves, each in their place. Afterwards
you will plough the ground, then you will harrow it, then sow the
wheat; you will then cut it, and you bring me at noon a little cake
made out of this wheat, otherwise you will be put to
death.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4252src" href="#xd26e4252"
name="xd26e4252src">49</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>The lad says to him, &ldquo;I will try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes then to the forest and sits down pensive. It was already
eleven o&rsquo;clock when the young lady appears to him. She says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you like that, so sad? Have not I promised that I
would help you? Shut your eyes, but all the worse for you if you shall
open them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She throws a comb into the air,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4265src"
href="#xd26e4265" name="xd26e4265src">50</a> and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comb, with thy power tear up these oaks with their roots, cut
them into lengths, put the trunks together, and the branches, and the
roots too by themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as it was said it was done. She throws another comb, and
says to it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comb, with thy power turn up this ground, harrow it, and sow
the wheat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as it was said it was done. She throws another comb, and
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comb, with thy power make a cake of this wheat when you have
cut it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our lad was curious to know what was taking place, but the young
lady said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe to you and to me if you open (your eyes).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4285src" href="#xd26e4285" name=
"xd26e4285src">51</a> Nothing will be finished for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He does not open them, and the cake is cooked. Twelve o&rsquo;clock
was going to strike. She says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go with speed, you have no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad goes to the king and brings him the cake. The king is
astonished. He says (to himself), &ldquo;That is a clever lad,
that,&rdquo; and he wishes to be assured of it by looking out of
window; and, after having seen that this huge forest had been torn up,
he is astonished. He sends away the lad, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>and goes and tells it
to his wife. His wife says to him, &ldquo;Take care that he is not in
league with your daughter.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4296src"
href="#xd26e4296" name="xd26e4296src">52</a></p>
<p>The husband says to her, &ldquo;What do you mean? They have never
seen each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This husband was a devil. The young lady told our lad that her
father is going to send him to fetch a ring in a river far away.
&ldquo;He will tell you to choose a sword from the midst of ever so
many others, but you will take an old sabre and leave the
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day his wife told him that he ought to send him to fetch a
ring which he had lost in the bed of a river. He sends him then, and
tells him that he must choose a sword; that he will have quantities of
evil fish to conquer. The lad says to him that he will not have those
fine swords, that he has enough with this old sabre, which was used to
scrape off the dirt.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the bank of the river he sat there weeping, not
knowing what to do. The young lady comes to him, and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You are weeping! Did not I tell you that I would always
help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock. The young lady says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must cut me in pieces with this sabre, and throw all the
pieces into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad will not do it by any means. He says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer to die here on the spot than to make you
suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady says to him, &ldquo;It is nothing at all what I shall
suffer, and you must do it directly&mdash;the favourable moment is
passing by like this, like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad, trembling all over, begins with his sabre. He throws all
the pieces into the river; but, lo! a part of the lady&rsquo;s little
finger sticks to a nail in his shoe. The young lady comes out of the
water and says to him: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not thrown everything into the water. My little
finger is wanting.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4326src" href=
"#xd26e4326" name="xd26e4326src">53</a></p>
<p>After having looked for it, he sees that he has it under his foot,
hooked on to a nail. The young lady gives him the ring. She tells him
to go without losing a moment; for he must give it to the king at noon.
He arrives happily (in time). The young lady, as she goes into the
house, bangs the door with all her might and begins to cry out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! ay! ay! I have crushed my little finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she makes believe that she has done it there. The king was
pleased. He tells him that on the morrow he must tame a horse and three
young fillies.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4335src" href="#xd26e4335"
name="xd26e4335src">54</a> The lad says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The master gives him a terrible club. The young lady says to him in
the evening:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse which my father has spoken to you about will be
himself. You will strike him with all your might with your terrible
club on the nose, and he will yield and be conquered. The first filly
will be my eldest sister. You will strike her on the chest with all
your force, and she also will yield and will be conquered. I shall come
the last. You will make a show of beating me too, and you will hit the
ground with your stick, and I too will yield, and I shall be
conquered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the lad does as the young lady has told him. The horse
comes. He was very high-spirited, but our lad strikes him on the nose,
he yields, and is conquered. He does the same thing with the fillies.
He beats them with his terrible club, they yield, and are conquered;
and when the third comes he makes a show of hitting her, and strikes
the earth. She yields, and all go off.</p>
<p>The next day he sees the master with his lips swollen, and with all
his face as black as soot. The young ladies had also pain in the chest.
The youngest also gets up very late indeed in order to do as the
others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>The master says to him that he sees he is a valuable servant, and
very clever, and that he will give him one of his daughters for wife,
but that he must choose her with his eyes shut. And the young lady says
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will choose the one that will give you her hand twice,
and in any way you will recognise me, because you will find that my
little finger is wanting. I will always put that in front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the master said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are here now; you shall now choose the one you wish for,
always keeping your eyes shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shuts them then; and the eldest daughter approaches, and gives
him her hand. He says to the king:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very heavy, (this hand); too heavy for me. I will not
have this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second one approaches, she gives him her hand, and he
immediately recognises that the little finger is wanting. He says to
the king:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the one I must have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are married immediately.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4368src"
href="#xd26e4368" name="xd26e4368src">55</a> They pass some days like
that. His wife says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better for us to be off from here, and to flee,
otherwise my father will kill us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set off, then, that evening at ten o&rsquo;clock, and the young
lady spits before the door of her room, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spittle, with thy power, you shall speak in my
place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4377src" href="#xd26e4377"
name="xd26e4377src">56</a> And they go off a long way. At midnight, the
father goes to the door of the lad and his wife, and knocks at the
door; they do not answer. He knocks harder, and then the spittle says
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now nobody can come into this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father says, &ldquo;It is I. I must come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; says the spittle again. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>The father grows more and more angry; the spittle makes him stop an
hour like that at the door. At last, not being able to do anything
else, he smashes the door, and goes inside. What is his terrible rage
when he sees the room empty. He goes off to his wife, and says to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not mistaken; they were well acquainted, and they
were really in league with one another, and they have both escaped
together; but I will not leave them like that. I will go off after
them, and I shall find them sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He starts off. Our gentleman and lady had gone very far, but the
young lady was still afraid. She said to her husband:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might overtake us even now. I&mdash;I cannot turn my head;
but (look) if you can see something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband says to her: &ldquo;Yes, something terrible is coming
after us; I have never seen a monster like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady throws up a comb, and says:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4400src" href="#xd26e4400" name="xd26e4400src">57</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Comb, with thy power, let there be formed before my father
hedges and thorns, and before me a good road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is done as she wished. They go a good way, and she says
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, I beg you, if you see anything again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband looks back, and sees nothing; but in the clouds he sees
something terrible, and tells so to his wife. And his wife says, taking
her comb:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comb, with thy power, let there be formed where he is a fog,
and hail, and a terrific storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happens as they wish. They go a little way farther, and his wife
says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look behind you, then, if you see anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband says to her: &ldquo;Now it is all over with us. We have
him here after us; he is on us. Use all your power.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>She throws again a comb immediately, and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comb, with thy power, form between my father and me a
terrible river, and let him be drowned there for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she has said that, they see a mighty water, and there
their father and enemy drowns himself.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4432src" href="#xd26e4432" name="xd26e4432src">58</a></p>
<p>The young lady says, &ldquo;Now we have no more fear of him, we
shall live in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go a good distance, and arrive at a country into which the
young lady could not enter. She says to her husband:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go no farther. It is the land of the Christians there;
I cannot enter into it. You must go there the first. You must fetch a
priest. He must baptize me, and afterwards I will come with you; but
you must take great care that nobody kisses you. If so, you will forget
me altogether. Mind and pay great attention to it; and you, too, do not
you kiss anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He promises his wife that he will not. He goes, then, on, and on,
and on. He arrives in his own country, and as he is entering it an old
aunt recognises him, and comes behind him, and gives him two
kisses.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4444src" href="#xd26e4444" name=
"xd26e4444src">59</a> It is all over with him. He forgets his wife, as
if he had never seen her, and he stays there amusing himself, and
taking his pleasure.</p>
<p>The young lady, seeing that her husband never returned, that
something had happened to him, and that she could no longer count upon
him, she takes a little stick, and striking the earth, she says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will that here, in this very spot, is built a beautiful
hotel, with all that is necessary, servants, and all the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a beautiful garden, too, in front, and she had put over
the door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they give to eat without payment.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day the young man goes out hunting with two comrades, and while
they were in the forest they said one to the other:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never knew of this hotel here before. We must go there
too. One can eat without payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go off then. The young lady recognises her husband very well,
but he does not recognise her at all. She receives them very well.
These gentlemen are so pleased with her, that one of them asks her if
she will not let him pass the night with her.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4462src" href="#xd26e4462" name="xd26e4462src">60</a> The young
lady says to him, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The other asks also, &ldquo;I,
too, was wishing it.&rdquo; The young lady says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow then, you, if you wish it, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And her husband says to her: &ldquo;And I after to-morrow
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady says to him, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; One of the young men
remains then. He passes the evening in great delight, and when the hour
comes for going to bed, the young lady says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you were small you were a choir-boy, and they used to
powder you; this smell displeases me in bed. Before coming there you
must comb yourself. Here is a comb, and when you have got all the
powder out, you may come to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our lad begins then to comb his hair, but never could he get all the
powder out, such quantities came out, and were still coming out of his
head; and he was still at it when the young lady rose. The lad said to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you are getting up before I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you not see that it is day? I cannot stop there any
longer. People will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young man goes off home without saying a word more. He meets his
comrade who was to pass the night with this young lady. He says to him:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are satisfied? You amused yourself well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly, very well. If the time flies as fast with you
as it did with me you will amuse yourself well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes off then to this house. The young lady says to him, after he
had had a good supper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before going to bed you must wash your feet. The water will
be here in this big copper; when you have them quite clean you may come
to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly he washes one, and when he has finished washing the
other, the first washed is still black and dirty. He washes it again,
and finds the foot that he has just well washed very dirty again. He
kept doing like that for such a long time. When the young lady gets up,
the gentleman says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You are getting up already, without me
coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not then come before day? I cannot stay any
longer in bed. It is daylight, and the people will begin (to
come).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young man withdraws as the other had done. Now it is the turn of
her husband. She serves him still better than the others; nothing was
wanting at his supper. When the hour for going to bed arrives, they go
to the young lady&rsquo;s room; when they are ready to get into bed,
the young lady says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put out the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He puts it out, and it lights again directly. He puts it out again,
and it lights again as soon as it is put out. He passes all the night
like that in his shirt, never being able to put out that light. When
daylight is come, the young lady says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know me then? You do not remember how you left
your wife to go and fetch a priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she had said that he strikes his head, and says to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only now I remember all that&mdash;up to this moment I was as
if I had never had a wife at all&mdash;how sorry I am; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>but
indeed it is not my fault, not at all. I never wished it like that, and
it is my old aunt who kissed me twice without my knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all the same now. You are here now. You have done
penance enough; your friends have done it too. One passed the whole
night getting powder out of his head, and the other in washing his
feet, and they have not slept with me any more than you have. At
present you must go into your country, and you must get a priest. He
shall baptize me, and then we will go into your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband goes off and returns with the priest, and she is
baptized, and they set out for his country. When they have arrived
there, she touched the earth with her stick, and says to it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let there be a beautiful palace, with everything that is
needed inside it, and a beautiful garden before the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as it is said, it is done. They lived there very rich and
very happy with the old mother of the lad, and as they lived well they
died well too.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Suggested Explanation of the above Tale (The
Lady-Pigeon and her Comb).</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This legend seems to us to be one of the best examples
in our collection of what may be called atmospherical, or
climatological myths.</p>
<p>The story opens with man in misery, without the aid of cultivation
and agriculture. The old king we take to be a personification of
winter; his daughter of spring, warmth, and fertility&mdash;of what the
French call &ldquo;la belle saison.&rdquo; The comb, with which she
does her marvels, is the power which draws out her golden hair, the
sun&rsquo;s bright rays. The young man, who, without her aid, can
effect nothing, is man in relation to the frozen ground, which needs
her aid to quicken it into fertility. It is the old Sun-god, the
Cyclops, who tells him where to find, and how to woo, his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>fairy bride. But spring and earth are as yet
both fast bound in winter&rsquo;s dominions. There he must go, and
learn what he must do, if they are to be married. The felling of the
forest, the sowing and ripening corn, and the cooked cake, teach him
that he can only succeed by her help; and yet he does not see how she
does it&mdash;man cannot see the corn grow, etc. The summer warmth and
fertilizing power, typified by the ring, still lies buried in the
frozen waters. The taming of the horses shows the need and help of
domestic animals in agriculture. These things are necessary to be known
ere spring can free herself from winter&rsquo;s dominion and marry her
chosen lover. Winter would still hold her fast; but even in his own
home her influence works secretly against him. He does not suspect that
she is in league with her lover. But at length they are joined
together; they flee, and the great struggle between winter and spring
has fairly set in. She is able to hide her flight a little while; but
he discovers it, and pursues and nearly overtakes her. But, by means of
her comb, scattering abroad her warm rays, she works wonders. He is
stopped by rough, wintry roads. Her path is through fair and pleasant
ways; the storms, and hail, and rain of early spring assist her, but it
is the mighty inundation of the swollen rivers which finally overwhelms
him, and sweeps him for ever away.</p>
<p>But their union is not complete yet. She cannot enter the
Christians&rsquo; land. The natural powers of earth and sky have need
of agriculture and civilization for their full expansion. And man,
frightened at the toil, is lured back again to the nomad hunter life.
He forgets his bride in the pleasures of the chase. He spends the
winter thus, but is drawn back by the attraction of his waiting bride
in spring. She has food in abundance; he is hungry. Other wooers come;
she cheats and deludes them, till her true husband appears, and submits
to her once more. Then is the full marriage of earth and husbandry, and
man wedded to the summer&rsquo;s warmth and glow. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>All parts of the tale are not equally clear, nor do we positively
affirm that we have interpreted it aright. But there can be no doubt
that we have here a nature allegory; and, told as it is by those who
have not the most remote suspicion of its meaning, many things in it
must needs be confused; the wonder is that the details are still so
clear and so little distorted as they are. And, if this be the
interpretation, or even if this kind of interpretation be allowed in
this case, then we must consider if it is not to be extended to every
case in which the several incidents occur, though they are now mingled
and confused with circumstances with which they had no original
connection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to marry one of your three daughters; if I do not
marry them, so much the worse for you&mdash;I will have you
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This vine-dresser goes away home in sadness. He tells his two eldest
daughters what Mr. Laur-Cantons had said to him. The daughters tell him
that they will not marry; it is useless to ask them. The father stays
indoors in his grief, and his youngest daughter comes home. He tells
her, too, what has happened, and this one says to her father,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be so sad; as for me, I will marry him, and nothing
shall happen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father and the daughter go off then. He marries this young girl.
And, as Mr. Laur-Cantons was very rich, he had quantities of beautiful
dresses made for her. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>had gold by hogsheads full, and
this young girl was very happy with this gentleman.</p>
<p>After some time the king summoned him to go to the army, and he was
obliged to go. He said to his wife, &ldquo;Amuse yourself well,&rdquo;
and he leaves her plenty of money.</p>
<p>His wife says, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she will remain at home till he
comes back, and will not see anybody until his return. Mr. Laur-Cantons
set off for the court. When he was there, a merchant attacks him on
purpose to vex him and put him in a passion, and tells him that he will
get into his wife&rsquo;s house, and he wagers all that he has in his
shop, and Mr. Laur-Cantons bets 100,000 francs that he will not get in.
This merchant then goes off to the lady&rsquo;s house. He knocks at the
door, and says that he comes with a letter from her husband, and begs
her to open the door. But they do not open it. They tell him to put the
letter in the hole; and, after having remained all night at the door in
vain, he goes off to the forest in a rage, kicking and stamping about
with his feet, because he had lost all that he possessed. An old woman
passes by there, and says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you, that you are in such great
trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be off with you, quickly, or I will give you two good boxes
on the ear.&rdquo; This woman was a witch. This man was sorry a moment
afterwards for not having listened to this old woman, and he goes off
after her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now I treated you very badly, but I must now tell you my
trouble. I have lost all that I possess in a bet with Mr. Laur-Cantons
that I would get into his wife&rsquo;s house, but I have passed the
whole night there, and have not been able to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have only that it is nothing, and I will arrange
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She goes with a basket of apples and knocks at the door, and says
that she is the lady&rsquo;s nurse, and asks them to open. They open
for her. The young lady shows her her dresses for the marriage day and
for the next day too, her gold <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134"
href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>chain, and all her pretty
things. While she is putting by her dresses the witch takes her gold
chain, which had the lady&rsquo;s name on it; and the lady did not
observe it, and did not miss anything when she shut up the others,
because she had full confidence in her, believing that she was really
her nurse, since she said so.</p>
<p>The witch goes off to find the merchant and gives him the gold
chain. The merchant gives her as a reward a complete set of new
clothes. The merchant goes off joyfully to find Mr. Laur-Cantons, and
shows him from a distance the gold chain. Imagine what was the rage of
the gentleman. He goes off home immediately. He knocks at the door,
saying that it is the master who is there; he enters, and says to his
wife, with harsh voice, to go upstairs and put on her wedding dress and
her gold ornaments. She comes down without putting it on at all, and he
says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your gold ornaments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not being able to find them, I have put on those of the next
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he has got on horseback he tells her to get up behind him. This
young lady, having suspected something, had taken a great deal of money
with her. When they had gone a short way he dismounts. He puts his wife
into a chest and throws her into the sea. On the sea-shore there are
always people looking about, and when the chest was seen they caught
hold of it as best they could. They begin to knock it, wishing to open
it. She says to them from inside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently, gently, there is someone alive inside
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had opened it she gave them a handsome present, and goes
to an hotel, and dresses herself like a gentleman. She asks if there is
anyone seriously ill in the town. They say to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the last seven years the king&rsquo;s daughter is
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She goes off to seek flowers and herbs in the fields, and she makes
acquaintance with the king&rsquo;s physicians; and one day she goes
with them to the king&rsquo;s house, and as they come out she says to
one of them: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I, I could cure that young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king hears that, and bids her to come as soon as possible. At
the first visit she gives her something to drink. As soon as she has
drunk she moves her head. She gives her to drink a second time, and she
sits up on the bed. The third time she gives her to drink she leaps
right out of bed. Think what rejoicings there were in the house of the
king! He did not know what to do to reward her, but she says to him
that she wishes nothing, only she would be made governor of this city.
She asks the names of the people at the court. They tell her a great
many names, and that of Mr. Laur-Cantons among others. When she has got
installed in her palace, she has Mr. Laur-Cantons brought up before her
between two policemen. She asks him what he has done with his wife. He
says to her that he knows nothing about her.</p>
<p>She points to the gallows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not tell the truth, that shall be your
reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells her then how that a merchant had come to tempt him; how he
had made a bet, and that he had come back with her gold chain, and
then, having got into a passion, he had thrown her into the sea in a
chest. She sends to fetch this merchant. He, too, tells how, in order
not to lose all he had, and not being able to get into the house, a
woman had brought him the chain. The merchant did not tell the truth at
the first questioning&mdash;it was after having been threatened that he
confessed it. She sends for the witch between eight policemen, and asks
her how she had got the gold chain from the lady&rsquo;s house. She
tells the whole truth as it had happened. As the governor had had seven
barrels of powder placed one above the other, they put the witch on the
top, and set fire to the barrels from below. The witch goes up in the
air with the fire, and nobody sees her any more. They hang the merchant
as well. Mr. Laur-Cantons was on his knees before the governor, begging
pardon of him for his wicked actions. She pardons him, and made him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>governor and she remained governess. She sent
for her father, and they lived very happily.</p>
<p>If that is not true, may it happen (to me) like that.</p>

<h4 class="main">The Young Schoolboy.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a gentleman and lady. They
had a child. The father was captain of a ship. The mother regularly
sent her son to school, and when the father came back from his voyages
he asked his child if he had learnt much at school. The mother
answered, &ldquo;No, no! not much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father went off for another voyage. He comes home the second
time. &ldquo;My child, what have you learnt at school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child answers his father, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have learnt nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain goes to find the schoolmaster, and asks him if his child
does not learn anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot drive anything into that child&rsquo;s
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy comes up, and the father, asks him again what he has learnt
at school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all. (To understand) the song of the
birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, my son, the song of the birds! the song of the birds!
Come, come on board ship with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he carries him off. While they were on the voyage a bird comes
and settles on the end of the ship, singing, &ldquo;Wirittitti,
kirikiriki.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, come, come, instead of beginning by learning the art
of a captain you have learned the song of birds. Do you know what this
bird sings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my father. I know he sings that I am now under your
orders, but you shall also be under mine.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>What does this captain do? He takes a barrel, knocks out the head,
and puts his son into it. He closes up the barrel and throws it into
the sea, and a storm casts it ashore.</p>
<p>A king was walking there just at that moment, and he finds this
barrel and sends for his men. They begin to try and break open the
barrel, and the boy cries out from inside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently, gently, there is someone inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They open the barrel, and the boy comes out from inside. The king
takes him home, and he marries the king&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>One day the father of this boy was caught in a great storm, and the
captain is thrown by the tempest on the sea-shore. He went to the king,
and saw his son. The son recognised the father, but the father did not
recognise the son at all, and he became his own son&rsquo;s servant.
One day he said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am such an one, your son. At such a time you threw me into
the sea in a barrel, and now the bird&rsquo;s song has come
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after that the father and the son lived together very
happily.</p>

<h4 class="main">The Son who Heard Voices.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a gentleman
and lady. They had several children. There was one whom they did not
love so much as they did the others, because he said that he heard a
voice very often. He said also that this voice had told him that a
father and a mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138"
name="pb138">138</a>]</span>would be servants to their son, but without
saying that it was they. When the mother heard that she got very angry,
taking it for herself. They were very rich, and they had two
men-servants. This mother told these servants to go with her son and
kill him, and bring his heart back to the house.</p>
<p>The next day she said to her son:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go for a walk to such a place with these servants,
and you may stop there till twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad goes off quietly with the servants, and when they had gone a
little distance, the two servants begin to talk loudly, and to dispute,
and get angry. He goes up to them, and sees what they are quarrelling
about. The one wished to kill him, and the other did not. They fought,
and the one who did not wish to kill him got the better of the other.
And they said that they would kill a big dog which they had with them,
and that they would carry his heart to their mistress. Before the
servants returned the mother had already begun to be sorry.</p>
<p>Our young man wandered from place to place, and wandering like that,
he said to himself that he must go to Rome. He meets with two men who
tell him that they are going to Rome too, and they will make the
journey together. They loved this young lad very much, because they saw
that there was something in him different from the rest. When night
came they all go to a house hidden in a thick forest. They ask shelter
for the night. They tell them to enter, and give them a good supper.
Our young lad hears the voice, and it says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in a very unhappy place here. It would have been
better if you had not come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other men said to him, &ldquo;What is that? What is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all. It would have been better to have gone
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had finished supper, they show them to bed, but our young
gentleman does not go to sleep. He hears in the middle of the night a
great noise made by the robbers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139"
href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>who were returning home laden
with silver. The woman said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go gently. We have three men here, and they say that one of
them is very rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young man hears that. He wakes his comrades, and they jump out
of the window and escape. They walk on the whole day. When night comes
they see a beautiful house, and they ask to be lodged there that night.
They said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, with pleasure, but you will not have much rest; we
have a daughter who for seven years shrieks out in pain night and
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These men say to the young man: &ldquo;Will not you cure
her&mdash;you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said to them: &ldquo;I will try.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>(The narrator had forgotten <i>how</i> this was done).</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>They were very rich. When he had cured the young girl, this poor
father said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, it is you who are now the master of this house. Give
your orders, and whatever you wish shall be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young gentleman thanks him very much, and tells him that he is
going to Rome, but that he cannot say what he will do later after that.
This young lady had a beautiful ring on her finger. The father cut this
ring in two, and gave him one-half. They depart, and at length they
arrive close to Rome, and as they come near all the bells begin to ring
of themselves. Everyone comes out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he? What is this? It is the Holy Father<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4721src" href="#xd26e4721" name=
"xd26e4721src">62</a> who must be coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They take our young gentleman and make him the Holy Father.</p>
<p>The mother of this man was growing sadder and sadder, she was slowly
languishing away, and they could no longer recognise her. She had never
told her husband what she had done, but she asked him to go to Rome;
and she ended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>by telling him what a terrible thing she had
done, and that she believes that she will get pardon there, if he would
go with her with the two servants who had also sinned. They arrive at
Rome. This poor mother had such great grief, and such a weight at her
heart that she wished to make her confession aloud in the middle of the
church at Rome.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4733src" href="#xd26e4733"
name="xd26e4733src">63</a> Chance willed it that her son was in this
church. When he hears that he goes opening his arms to the arms of his
mother, saying to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgive you, I am your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The joy and the happiness kill the father and mother on the spot. He
takes the two servants home with him, and gives to him who did not wish
to kill him the half of the young lady&rsquo;s ring, and he married
her, and lived happily in the midst of riches. He told the servant who
wished to kill him to go to the mountain and to be a charcoal-burner,
and he is still there making charcoal; and this charcoal which you see
here was brought from his house.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there were a mother and
her son; they were poor, and the young man, when he grew up, wished to
go from home, to see if he could better his position. His mother lets
him go with great reluctance. He goes on, and on, and on through
terrible forests. He comes to a beautiful house, and asks if they want
a servant. They tell him &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and to come in; and then
they tell him how they go at night to rob people, and sometimes to kill
them; and they ask if he would go too. He says &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>and in the middle of the night he sees the chief
of the robbers arrive, with all his company, laden with gold and
silver; and he remained a long time with them.</p>
<p>One day the chief said to him, &ldquo;At such an hour a rich
gentleman on horseback will pass by such a place, and you must go and
rob him; and, if he will not give it up willingly, you must kill
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our lad had had enough of this trade; but he told the chief that he
would do it. He stays then, waiting for this gentleman, and at last he
sees him coming. He presents himself before him, and says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your purse or your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman gives him his purse and all the money that he had, and
he had a great deal. He said to him, &ldquo;It is not enough yet. You
must give me your fine clothes too, and your horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They exchange clothes, and the gentleman goes off, very glad,
although he had old clothes on, because he had spared him his life.
Instead of returning to the robbers&rsquo; house, what does our lad do?
He goes off on horseback with his money to his mother&rsquo;s house.
Everyone was astonished at his arrival, and that he had made his
fortune so quickly. He goes to his mother, and judge of her joy! He
tells her how it is that he has become so rich, and that it all
happened far, far away. His mother told it to others, and at last this
news comes to the ears of the mayor, who sends his servant to this
young man to tell him to come to his house on the morrow without
fault.</p>
<p>He goes then, leaving his mother in tears. His mother told him to
tell the mayor how he had made his fortune so quickly. He tells him
what business he had pursued, but that it was very far away, and that
he had never killed anybody. The mayor said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not steal my finest horse from my stable this very
night, I will have you killed to-morrow.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4778src" href="#xd26e4778" name="xd26e4778src">65</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>This mayor was very rich, and he had a great many servants and a
great many horses. There were three of them finer and more valuable
than the others. Our lad goes home and consoles his mother. He asks her
to give him his old clothes which he wore formerly, and, putting them
over the others, he takes a big stick, and goes off to the
mayor&rsquo;s, crawling along like an old man. He knocks at the door,
and asks shelter for the night. A lad comes to him, and says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not give you shelter in this house to-night. You may
go on farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he begs so much, and asks him to give him at least a corner of
the stable&mdash;that he does not know where to go to&mdash;that at
last they let him enter, and give him a little straw (to lie down on).
Our lad hears what they say to each other. Three lads were to stop till
midnight on the three finest horses, and at midnight three other
servants were to take their places. What does our lad do? They were
asleep on their horses. As soon as he hears midnight, he goes and gives
one of them a knock, and says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is midnight; go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half asleep, the lad goes off to bed; the others were still asleep
on their horses. He mounts on the horse&mdash;he had chosen the
finest&mdash;and opens the doors very gently, and goes off at a trot,
without looking behind him. He goes home, and his mother is very
delighted to see her son.</p>
<p>The next day he goes to market to sell his horse. When the mayor
gets up he goes to the stable, and sees that his finest horse is
missing. The servants were sleeping on their horses, and the others in
bed. He gets into a rage, and does not know what to do. He sends to the
mother&rsquo;s to ask her where her son is. She replies that he is gone
to sell a horse. They tell her that the mayor <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4795" title="Source: summonses">summons</span> him immediately.
The mother grows sad again, and tells her son what they have said to
her, and off he goes.</p>
<p>The mayor says to him, &ldquo;What a fellow you are! You won the
game yesterday, but if you do not steal from our <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>oven
to-night all the bread that is in it, it shall be all over with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mayor assembles all the municipal council and all his friends,
thinking he would have some fun while guarding his oven. They had
dances, and music, and games, and brilliant lights, and all sorts of
amusements, and all this in front of the oven. What does our lad do? He
takes a little hammer, and goes behind the oven. He makes a hole, and
by that takes out all the loaves, and puts them in his basket, and goes
home.</p>
<p>The next day the mayor was proud because they had not stolen his
loaves, and because they had so well guarded the door of the oven, and
he sends his servant to fetch a loaf for breakfast. When she opens the
door of the oven, she sees the sun through the other end of the oven.
Judge of their astonishment! The mayor was in a red-hot passion. He
sends to fetch the lad. They go and ask his mother where her son is.
She answers, &ldquo;Selling bread.&rdquo; And they tell the mayor. He
sends to tell her to tell her son to come to him as soon as he comes
home. The poor mother is again in great distress. When her son arrives,
she tells him the message, and off he goes.</p>
<p>The mayor says to him, &ldquo;Yesterday, too, you have hit the mark;
but you have not finished yet. This very night you must steal the
sheets which we have under us in our bed, otherwise your life shall be
put an end to.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4808src" href=
"#xd26e4808" name="xd26e4808src">66</a></p>
<p>He goes home, and he makes an image of himself from his old clothes;
and, when night is come, he goes off dragging it to the mayor&rsquo;s.
The mayor had placed guards at all the windows and doors, with arms.
Our lad ties his image to a long stick, and, by drawing a cord, he
hoists it against the wall. When the guards see a man climbing up the
wall near a window, they fire, and all begin to cry out
&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; At this noise the mayor leaps out of bed,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>thinking that they have killed him, and that he
must go and see him too. Our lad takes advantage of this moment to
enter the house, and he goes to the mayor&rsquo;s bed, and
says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is cold, it is cold;&rdquo; and keeps pulling and pulling
all the bed-clothes to his side. When he has all, he says to the
lady:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go and look again, to be quite sure, and to see if
they have buried him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife said to him, &ldquo;Stop here then; you will come back dead
of cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes off, and escapes very quickly, as well as he can, with the
sheets. The others are out-doing each other, one beating, the other
stabbing, the other pulling about (the image). At last they go
in-doors, quite out of breath. All are pleased, and proud that they
have their lad at last down there.</p>
<p>The mayor goes to bed, and his wife says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, at least, you will remain here without any more of this
going and coming down there, and making me all cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been going and coming. I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; you were certainly here just now, you
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gets into bed, and he keeps turning and moving about, not being
able to find the sheets. At last, getting impatient, he lights the
candle, and he sees that the sheets are not there. Judge of their
anger; they did not know what to do. The wife said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better leave that man alone, or some misfortune will
happen to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He will not listen to anything, and goes off. He sends to fetch him
as soon as daylight comes. They find his mother, and ask her where her
son is. She answers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone to sell some sheets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They say to her, &ldquo;You will send him to the mayor&rsquo;s when
he comes home.&rdquo; And this poor woman is again in great trouble,
for at last (she thinks) they will make an end <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>of
her son. She sends him again to the mayor&rsquo;s, who says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time you shall not escape me. If you do not steal all
the money of my brother the priest, you are done for.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4847src" href="#xd26e4847" name=
"xd26e4847src">67</a></p>
<p>The brother of the mayor was rector of this town. When evening came
our lad hides himself in the church, and dresses himself in the finest
of the church robes, (used only) for the highest festivals. He lights
all the candles and the lamps, and at midnight he begins to ring all
the bells at full swing&mdash;dilin, don; dilin, don, don; dilin, don.
The rector comes running with his servant to see what is happening in
the church, and they see on the high altar someone, who says to
them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prostrate yourselves. I am the good God. I am come to fetch
you. You must die; but before dying you must bring here all the money,
and all the riches that you have in your houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest goes and brings everything. He makes the priest go to the
top of the tower, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are now going into purgatory, but afterwards you will go
to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He makes him get into a sack, takes hold of one end, and drags him
down the stairs, bumping, <span lang="eu">zimpi eta zampa</span>, on
all the steps. He cried, &ldquo;Ay! ay!&rdquo; and he says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is nothing; soon you will be in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he carries him like that to his brother&rsquo;s chicken-house,
and leaves him there. The next morning the maid goes to feed the fowls.
She sees a sack, and touches it, and the sack moves. The girl goes off
running to tell her mistress what she has seen. Her mistress goes and
touches it, and the sack does the same thing. She is frozen with
fright, and goes to her husband, and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see that I told you right to let that man alone. At
present, what will become of us? What can there be in that sack?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>The gentleman immediately sends someone to fetch this lad. He was
just at that moment at home, and they tell him that the mayor orders
him to come directly. They tell him to open the sack. He touches it,
and the sack gives a leap; and he says that he will not open it, not
for ten thousand francs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you ten thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! not for twenty thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give them you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no! not even for forty thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you thirty thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no! not even for forty thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for fifty thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He agreed to open it, and he hands them their brother, the priest,
whom he had left without a sou. After having got his fifty thousand
francs, our lad went off well satisfied to his home, and lived there
rich with his mother; and the mayor lived with his brother, the priest,
poorer than he was before. And if they had lived well, they would have
died well too.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a gentleman
and lady who had a son. When he was grown up his father found that (his
intellect) was not awakened, although he had finished his education.
What does he do? He buys <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>a ship for him, and takes a
captain and a crew, and loads the ship with sand, and sends his son in
it as master.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4899src" href="#xd26e4899"
name="xd26e4899src">69</a> They all set off, and go very, very far
away, and they come to a country where there was no sand. They sell
theirs very dear, and our Juan Dekos went to take a walk in that
place.</p>
<p>One day, passing before the door of the church, he sees that all
passers-by used to spit on something; he goes up and asks why they do
that. They say to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a dead man who is there, and if no one pays his debts,
he will remain there until he rots away.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4906src" href="#xd26e4906" name="xd26e4906src">70</a></p>
<p>What does Juan Dekos do? With all the money that he had he pays this
man&rsquo;s debts. The whole crew and the officers were in a red-hot
rage, because they had all their money there. He goes back again with
his ship, and they arrived in their own city. The father from a
distance had recognised his son&rsquo;s ship, and comes to meet him.
The sailors from a long way off shout out to him what he had done with
the money. The father was not pleased, but he sends the ship off again
loaded with iron. They go on, and at length arrive at a place where he
sells his iron for a great deal of money. When they were walking about
in this city, he sees Christians being sold by the savages in the
market-place. There were eight of them for sale; and he buys all the
eight, and employs all the money which he had made with his iron in
buying them. He sends seven of them to their own homes, and keeps with
him a young girl whose name was Marie Louise. She was very beautiful.
He returns home with his ship, and his crew, and Marie Louise. The
father comes to meet him, and the sailors tell him before Juan Dekos
what he had done with the money. His father was very angry, and will
not give anything more to his son; he may do what he likes.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>Juan Dekos had a portrait of Marie Louise made for the figure-head
of his ship; and the men agree to go to the country of Marie Louise.
They set out then. The second in command of the ship was lame, and he
was very jealous of Juan Dekos and of Marie Louise. He did not know
what to do.</p>
<p>One day he sent for Juan Dekos on deck, saying that he wished to
show him a strange fish that was in the water. When he had got him
quite close to him, he throws him into the sea. Nobody was there when
he did that. When the meal-time comes they all asked where Juan Dekos
was, and nobody knew what was become of him. The lame man was
delighted, thinking that Marie Louise would be his. He pays her all
sorts of attention.</p>
<p>Juan Dekos was taken by an angel and placed upon a rock, and he
brought him there every day what was necessary for his maintenance. The
ship at length arrived in the country of Marie Louise. As she was the
king&rsquo;s daughter everybody recognised her, and that easily, from a
distance by her portrait. The king was quickly told of it, and goes to
meet his daughter, and you may imagine what rejoicings he made. He has
all the men conducted to his house and treats them all well. Marie
Louise tells how she had been bought by Juan Dekos, and how good he had
been to her, and that she does not know what had become of him. She
said also that the second officer had taken very great care of her.
This second officer wished beyond all things to marry her, and the
father wished it too, to show his gratitude, because it was he who had
brought his daughter back to him, and because he had not known Juan
Dekos. They tormented Marie Louise so much that she promised that, at
the end of a year and a day, if Juan Dekos did not make his appearance,
she would marry him.</p>
<p>A year and a day passed, and there was no news of Juan Dekos. They
were to be married then, and Juan Dekos was still upon his rock. The
sea-weed was growing upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>his clothes, and he had a
monstrous beard. And the angel<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4922src"
href="#xd26e4922" name="xd26e4922src">71</a> said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie Louise is married to-day. Would you like to be
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must give me your word of honour that, at the end of a
year, you will give me half the child that Marie Louise will bear to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He promises it, and he takes him and carries him to the door of
Marie Louise&rsquo;s house. This angel was the soul which he had saved
of the man who was lying at the gates of the church for his debts. He
asks for alms. Marie Louise&rsquo;s father was very charitable; they
therefore give him something. He asks again if they would not let him
go in to warm himself at the fire. They tell him &ldquo;No,&rdquo; that
he would be in the way on that day. They go and ask the master, and the
master bids them to let him come in and to give him a good dinner.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was already married when Juan Dekos arrived. He had a
handsome handkerchief which Marie Louise had given him, and when she
passed he showed it in such a way that she could not help seeing it.
She saw it clearly, and after looking closely at him she recognises
Juan Dekos. Marie Louise goes to find her father, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, you must do me a pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, if I can do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see that poor man? I wish to have him to dine with us
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father says, &ldquo;That cannot be; he is filthy and
disgusting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wash him, and I will put him some of your new clothes
on.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>The father then says, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and he makes them do as
Marie Louise wished. They place him at table, but Marie Louise alone
recognised him. After dinner they asked Juan Dekos to tell a story in
his turn like the rest.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Yes, but if you wish to hear my story you must shut
all the doors and give me all the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They give them to him.</p>
<p>He begins: &ldquo;There was a father and a mother who had a son who
was not very bright, and they decide that they must send him to sea.
They load a ship with sand for him. He sells this sand very well, and
pays the heavy debts of a dead man whom they were keeping at the church
doors (without burial).&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the second officer saw and heard that, he perceived that his
life was in danger, and that it was all up with him, and he begs the
king for the key of the door, saying that he must go out; but he could
not give it him, so he was forced to remain, and not at all at his
ease. Juan Dekos begins again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father loaded the ship again with iron, and he sells it
and bought with this money seven Christians, and,&rdquo; pointing to
the king&rsquo;s daughter, &ldquo;there is the eighth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king knew this story already from his daughter. What do they do
then? When they see how wicked the second officer had been, they had a
cartload of faggots brought into the middle of the market-place, they
put a shirt of sulphur upon him, and burn him in the midst of the
place.</p>
<p>Juan Dekos and Marie Louise marry and are very happy. They had a
child, and at the end of a year an angel comes to fetch the half of it.
Juan Dekos was very sorry, but as he had given his word he was going to
cut it in half. The angel seizes him by the arm, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your obedience; I leave you your child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If they lived well, they died well too. <span class=

<h4 class="main">Juan de Kalais.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4978src"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As there are many in the world, and as there will be,
there was a mother and her son. They had a small fortune. Nothing would
please the boy but that he should go and learn to be a sailor. The
mother allows him to do so, and when he was passed as captain she gives
him a ship with a valuable cargo. The lad starts off and comes to a
city. While he was there he sees a crowd of men on a dung-heap, who
were dragging an object, some on one side and others on the other. He
approaches and sees that they have a dead man there. He asks what they
are doing like that for, and why they do not bury him. They tell him
that he has left debts, and that they will not bury him, even though he
should fall to pieces.</p>
<p>Juan de Kalais asks, &ldquo;And if anyone should pay his debts,
would you bury him then?&rdquo; They say, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juan de Kalais has it cried throughout the city that whoever has to
receive anything of that man should show himself. As you may suppose,
many came forward, even those who had nothing to receive. Our Juan de
Kalais sold his cargo, and still, not having enough, he sold his ship
too.</p>
<p>He returns home and tells his mother what he has done. His mother
was very angry, and said that he would never grow rich if he acted like
that. But, as he wished much to go again, his mother bought for him a
wretched little ship and loads it with oakum, and tar, and resin, and
he goes on his voyage. He meets with a large man-of-war, and the
captain tells him that he must buy of him a charming young lady. Juan
de Kalais tells him that he has no money, but the other captain (he was
an Englishman) tells him to give him his cargo at least. Juan de Kalais
says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not worth much.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the English captain says to him that it is, that it just happens
to be most valuable to him, and they make the exchange. Our Juan de
Kalais goes to his mother&rsquo;s house, and his mother was more angry
than before, saying she had nothing now with which to load his ship.
She had nothing, and would give him nothing; that instead of getting
rich they had become poor, and that it would have been better if he had
stopped at home. After some days he married the young lady whom the
captain had given him, and as Juan de Kalais was in poverty and
distress, not having any cargo, his wife told him that he had no need
of cargo&mdash;that she will give him a flag and a handkerchief, and
she gave him her ring and told him to go to the roadstead of Portugal
and to fire three rounds of cannon; and, when people came, to tell them
that he must see the king. (She added) that she was called Marie
Madeleine. Our Juan de Kalais sets off and arrives in the roadstead of
Portugal, and fires his three rounds of cannon. Everybody is astonished
at hearing this noise. The king himself comes on board the ship and
asks how they dared to fire, and that everyone is a prisoner.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4996src" href="#xd26e4996" name=
"xd26e4996src">73</a> He answers that he brings news of Marie
Madeleine, and he shows him the flag with her portrait and the
handkerchief. The king did not know where he was with joy, and he tells
him that he must go directly and fetch her.</p>
<p>The king had with him an old general<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5001src" href="#xd26e5001" name="xd26e5001src">74</a> who had
wished to marry Marie Madeleine, but she would not; and he asks the
king if he might not go too with him&mdash;that he would do it quicker.
The king told him to go then if he wished, and they set out.</p>
<p>When they were at sea the old general said to Juan de Kalais one
day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Juan de Kalais, what a fine fish there is
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looks and does not see anything. The old general says to him
again: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stoop down your head, and look here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the same time he throws him into the sea. The old general
goes on his voyage, and takes the young lady and goes back to the king,
and makes him believe that Juan de Kalais was drowned, and he still
wished to marry Marie Madeleine; but she would by no means consent,
(saying) that she had been married to Juan de Kalais, and that she was
so deeply sorry for him that she would remain seven years without going
out of her room. As her father wished her to marry this general she
decided to do so then.</p>
<p>Let us now go to the poor Juan de Kalais. He remained seven years on
a rock, eating sea-weed and drinking the sea-water. There came to him a
fox,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5018src" href="#xd26e5018" name=
"xd26e5018src">75</a> who said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know, Juan de Kalais, the daughter of the King of
Portugal is going to be married to-morrow. What would you give to go
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The half of what I have at present, and the half of what I
shall have later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fox takes him and carries him to the door of the house of the
King of Portugal, and leaves him there. Juan de Kalais asks if they
want a servant. They tell him that they will have work for him
too&mdash;that they will have a wedding in the house to-morrow. The
lady&rsquo;s maid recognised Juan de Kalais, and goes running to tell
it to the queen, who will not believe it&mdash;(she says) that he was
drowned. The servant, after having looked at him again, assures her
that it is he; and the princess, to put an end to the dispute, goes off
to see him, and quickly assures herself that it is he, seeing the ring
that she had given him. She throws herself into his arms, and makes him
come with her to the king. The king said to her that they would have
the wedding feast just the same. While they were at table the king
asked Juan de Kalais to tell them some story. Juan de Kalais says
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and takes out his sword, and puts it on the table,
saying, &ldquo;Whoever speaks shall have news of my sword.&rdquo; He
begins to tell how he had saved a man by selling all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>that
he had and paying his debts; how afterwards he had made an exchange for
a young lady&mdash;that in order to save her he had given all his
cargo; then how he had been betrayed by one of his friends and thrown
into the water, and that he had lived on sea-weed and sea-water.</p>
<p>When the king had heard that he ordered the old general to be
arrested, and has him burnt immediately in the midst of the
market-place.</p>
<p>The king gives Juan de Kalais all his riches, and they lived very
happily. At the end of a year they had a fine boy, and lo! the fox
comes and tells him that he has come to look for what he has promised
him, and he begins to make a division. If there were two gold chains he
put one aside, and of all that there was the same thing. When they had
finished the division the fox said to him that there was still
something&mdash;that he had told him it was to be the half of all he
might possess. He remembers then his child, and takes out his sword to
cut it in half, when the fox with his paw knocks the sword out of his
hand, saying that it is enough; that he sees what a sterling good man
he is, and that he wants nothing; that he (the fox) is the soul which
he had saved by paying his debts, and that he is now in Heaven, thanks
to him, and that he will keep his place and that of all his family
ready there; and having said that he flew away, taking the form of a
pigeon.</p>

<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a man and his
wife. The man&rsquo;s name was Petarillo. He was fond of sporting. One
day he caught two leverets, and the parish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>priest came to see him. The husband said to his
wife&mdash;&ldquo;If the priest comes again you will let one of the
hares go, as if to meet me, tying, at the same time, a letter round its
neck, and I will tie another letter to the other hare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest goes to the house one day, and asks where the husband is.
The woman says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send one of the hares with a letter to fetch him. No
matter where he is, she will find him; he has trained them so
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she lets one of the hares loose. They grew impatient at the long
delay, and had given it up, when at last the husband came. His wife
says to him, &ldquo;I sent the hare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answers, &ldquo;I have it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonished priest says to him, &ldquo;You must sell me that
hare, I beg you; you have trained it so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second time he says, &ldquo;You <i>must</i> sell it me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man said to him, &ldquo;I will not give it you for less than
five hundred francs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you will give it me for three hundred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he gives it him for four hundred. The priest tells his
housekeeper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any one comes, you will let the hare loose; she will find
me, no matter where I may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man comes to the parsonage to say that a sick person is asking for
the priest. She immediately lets the hare loose, being quite sure that
that would be enough. But the priest did not return. The man got tired
of waiting, and went off. The housekeeper told the priest that she had
let the hare loose, and that she had seen nothing more of it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=

<p>In a rage, he goes to the huntsman&rsquo;s house. But Petarillo,
seeing him coming in a rage, gives a wine-skin to his wife, and says to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put this under your jacket. When the priest is here, I will
plunge a knife into you in a rage, and you will fall as if you were
dead; and when I shall begin to play the flute, you will get up as if
yon were alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest arrives in a great rage, (they all three dispute), and
the man stabs his wife. She falls on the ground, and the priest says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what you have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replies, &ldquo;It is nothing; I will soon put it to
rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he takes his flute, and begins to play. She gets up all alive
again, and the priest says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do sell me that flute, I beg you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answers that it is of great value, and that he will not sell
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>must</i> sell it me. How much do you want for it?
I will give you all you ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred francs.&rdquo; And he gives it him.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s housekeeper used sometimes to laugh at him. So
when he came home he wanted to frighten her a little; and, as usual,
she begins to make fun of him; and he stabs her with the large
carving-knife. His sister says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what you have done? You have killed your
housekeeper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! I can put that to rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He begins to play on the flute, but it does no good at all. He
rushes off in a rage to the huntsman&rsquo;s house, and he ties the
huntsman in a sack, and hauls him off to throw him into the sea. As he
passes near the church, the bell begins to ring for Mass, and he leaves
the man there till he has said Mass. Meanwhile a shepherd passes. He
asks him what he is doing there. He says to him, &ldquo;The priest is
going to throw me into the sea because I will not marry the
king&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other said to him, &ldquo;I will put myself in your place,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>and I will deliver you. When you have tied me
up, go away with my flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the priest returned, after having said Mass, he takes up the
sack, and the man says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will marry the king&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will marry you presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he throws him into the sea.</p>
<p>The good priest was returning home, when he sees the man with the
sheep, and says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that flock from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the bottom of the sea. There are plenty there.
Don&rsquo;t you see that white head, how it lifts itself above the
sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I, too, must have a flock like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come close to the edge, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And our huntsman pushes him into the sea.</p>

<p>We have other tales about priests, all in the same spirit as this.
The Basques are a deeply religious people, and are generally on the
best terms with the clergy; but they will not be dominated by them. Any
attempt at undue interference in their national games or customs is
sure to be resented; of this we have known several instances&mdash;some
rather amusing ones. G. H., the narrator of the above tale, did not
know a word of French.</p>
<p>Some of Campbell&rsquo;s stories begin a little like these,
<i>e.g.</i>, Vol. I., p. 95, Macdonald&rsquo;s tale&mdash;&ldquo;There
was a king and a knight, as there was and will be, and as grows the fir
tree, some of it crooked and some of it straight, and he was King of
Eirinn.&rdquo; The ending, &ldquo;If they had lived well, they would
have died well too,&rdquo; recals a Latin inscription still
occasionally to be seen on Basque houses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We do not suppose that the tales here given are the
only ones in our collection which are derived more or less directly
from or through the French. Several of those previously given under
different heads we believe to have been so. The question, however,
still remains: Whence did Madame d&rsquo;Aulnoy, Perrault, and the
other writers of the charming &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Contes des
F&eacute;es</span>,&rdquo; derive their materials? Place their talent
as high as we may, we still believe them to have been incapable of
inventing them. Combine, transpose, dress up, refine&mdash;all this
they did in an incomparable manner. Some portions they may have culled,
directly or indirectly, from Eastern stories; their own imagination may
have filled up many a blank, expanded many a hint, clothed many a
half-dressed body in the habit of their own times&mdash;as heraldic
painters formed grotesque monsters by selecting and putting together
parts from many diverse animals; but to create, even in fancy, was
beyond their line, if it is not altogether beyond the power of man.
Therefore, when we hear these tales related by peasants ignorant of
French, we may still ask how far they have learnt them at second or
third hand from the printed works, and how far they are reciting the
crude materials out of which those works were originally composed? This
is a question which can only be fully answered when all the legends in
all the languages and patois of France shall have been collected and
compared. Meanwhile, we beg our readers to accept these few tales as a
small and not very valuable stone contributed towards the erection of
so vast an edifice.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a king and a
queen. One day there came to them a young girl who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>wished for a situation. They asked her her name,
and she said &ldquo;Faithful.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5179src" href="#xd26e5179" name="xd26e5179src">78</a> The king
said to her, &ldquo;Are you like your name?&rdquo; and she said
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped there seven years. Her master gave her all the keys,
even that of the treasure. One day, when the king and queen were out,
Faithful goes to the fountain, and she sees seven robbers coming out of
the house. Judge what a state this poor girl was in! She runs straight
to the treasury, and sees that more than half the treasure is missing.
She did not know what would become of her&mdash;she was all of a
tremble. When the king and queen came home she told them what had
happened, but they would not believe her, and they put her in prison.
She stays there a year. She kept saying that she was not in fault, but
they would not believe her. The king condemns her to death, and sends
her with four men to the forest to kill her, telling them to bring him
her heart.</p>
<p>They go off, but these men thought it a pity to kill this young
girl, for she was very pretty, and she told them that she was innocent
of this robbery; and they say to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will not come any more into this land, we will spare
your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She promises them that she will not be seen again in those parts.
The men see an ass, and they tell her that they will carry its heart to
the king. The young girl said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flay this ass, I pray you; and, in order that no one may know
me, I will never take this skin off me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men (do so), and go off to the king, and the young girl goes to
look for some shelter. At nightfall she finds a beautiful house. She
asks if they want some one to keep the geese. They tell her,
&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes.&rdquo; They put her along with the geese, and
tell her that she must go with them every day to such a field. She went
out very early in the morning and came back late. It was the
king&rsquo;s house, and it was the queen-mother and her son who lived
there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>After some time there appeared to her one day an old woman, who
called to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faithful, you have done penance enough. The son of the king
is going to give some grand feasts, and you must go to them. This
evening you will ask madame permission, and you will tell her that you
will give her all the news of the ball if she will let you go for a
little while. And, see, here is a nut. All the dresses and things you
want will come out of that. You will break it as you go to the place of
the festival.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5199src" href=
"#xd26e5199" name="xd26e5199src">79</a></p>
<p>That evening she asked permission of her mistress to go and see the
festival which the king is going to give, for a short time only, and
that she will return directly and tell her all that she has seen there.
Her mistress said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; That evening she goes then. On
her way she breaks the nut, and there comes out of it a silver robe.
She puts it on, and goes there, and immediately she enters all the
world looks at her. The king is bewitched, he does not quit her for an
instant, and they always dance together. He pays no attention at all to
the other young ladies. They enjoy the refreshments very much. Some
friends of the king call him, and he has to go there; and in this
interval Faithful makes her escape to the house.</p>
<p>She tells the queen how that a young girl had come to the ball, how
she had dazzled everybody, and especially the king, who paid attention
to her alone, but that she had escaped.</p>
<p>When the son comes to the house, his mother says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She escaped from you then, your young lady? She did not care
for you, doubtless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to his mother, &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ass&rsquo;-skin; she wished to go and see it.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king goes to where Faithful was and gives her two blows with his
slipper, saying to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you return there again I will kill you on the
spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Ass&rsquo;-skin goes with her geese, and there appears
to her again the old woman. She tells her that she ought to go to the
ball again this evening&mdash;that her mistress would give her
permission. &ldquo;Here is a walnut; you have there all that is
necessary to dress yourself with. The king will ask you your
name&mdash;Braf-le-mandoufle.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5225src" href="#xd26e5225" name="xd26e5225src">80</a></p>
<p>In the evening she asks permission of her mistress, but she is
astonished (at her asking), and says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know what the king has said&mdash;that if he
catches you he will kill you on the spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid. He will be sure not to catch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She goes off, and on the way she breaks the walnut, and there comes
out of it a golden robe. She goes in. The king comes with a thousand
compliments, and asks her how she had escaped the evening before
without saying anything to him, and that he had been very much hurt at
it.</p>
<p>They amuse themselves thoroughly. The king has eyes for her alone.
He asks her her name. She tells him, &ldquo;Braf-le-mandoufle.&rdquo;
They feast themselves well, and some friends having called to him he
goes to them, and the young lady escapes.</p>
<p>Ass&rsquo;-skin goes to tell the queen that yesterday
evening&rsquo;s young lady had come, but still more
beautiful&mdash;that she had escaped in the very middle of the ball.
She goes off to her geese. The king comes to his house. His mother says
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came then, the young lady you love? but she only loves
you so-so, since she has gone off in this fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ass&rsquo;-skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes off to her and gives her two kicks with his slipper, and
says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe to you if you go there again; I will kill you on the very
spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She goes off to her geese, and the old woman comes to her again and
tells her to ask permission again for this evening&mdash;that she must
go to the dance. She gives her a peach, and tells her that she will
have there all that is necessary to dress herself with. She goes then
to ask her mistress if she will give her permission, like last night,
to go to the ball. She says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I will give you leave. But are you not afraid lest
the king should catch you? He has said that he will kill you if you go
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid, because I am sure that he will not catch me.
Yesterday he looked for me again, but he could not catch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She goes off then. On the way she opens her peach, and finds there a
dress entirely of diamonds, and if she was beautiful before, judge what
she is now! She shone like the sun. The king was plunged into joy when
he saw her. He was in an ecstasy. He did not wish to dance, but they
sat down at their ease on beautiful arm-chairs, and with their
refreshments before them they passed such a long time together. The
king asked her to give him her promise of marriage. The young lady
gives him her word, and the king takes his diamond ring off his finger
and gives it to her. His friends call him away to come quickly to see
something very rare, and off he goes, leaving his lady. She takes
advantage of this opportunity to escape.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5266src" href="#xd26e5266" name="xd26e5266src">81</a> She tells
her mistress all that has passed&mdash;how that this young lady had
come with a dress of diamonds, that all the world was dazzled by her
beauty, that they could not even look at her she shone so brightly,
that the king did not know where he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>was for happiness,
that they had given each other their promise of marriage, and that the
king had given her his diamond ring, but that the best thing of all was
that to-day again she has escaped him.</p>
<p>The king comes in at that very instant. His mother says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has not, she certainly has not, any wish for you. She has
gone off with your diamond ring. Where will you go and look for her?
You do not know where she lives. Where will you ask for a young lady
who has such a name as &lsquo;Braf-le-mandoufle!&rsquo; She has given
you her promise of marriage too; but she does not wish to have you,
since she has acted like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our king did not even ask his mother who has told her that. He went
straight to bed thoroughly ill, and so Ass&rsquo;-skin did not have her
two kicks that evening.</p>
<p>The queen was in great trouble at seeing her son ill like that. She
was continually turning over in her head who this young lady might be.
She said to her son, &ldquo;Is this young lady our Ass&rsquo;-skin? How
else could she have known that you had given your promise to one
another, and that you had given her the ring too? She must have been
very close to you. Did you see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but remains buried in thought.</p>
<p>His mother says, &ldquo;She has a very pretty face under her
ass&rsquo;-skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she says that she must send for her, and that he must have a
good look at her too; that he shall have some broth brought up by
her.</p>
<p>She sends for Ass&rsquo;-skin to the kitchen, has the broth made for
her son, and Ass&rsquo;-skin puts in the middle of the bread the ring
which the king had given her. The lady had her well dressed, and she
goes to the king. The king, after having seen her, was still doubtful.
He drank his broth; but when he puts the bread into his mouth he finds
something (hard), and is very much astonished at seeing his ring. He
was ill no longer. He goes and runs to his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>mother to tell her his joy that he has found his
lady. He wishes to marry directly, and all the kings of the
neighbourhood are invited to the feast; and, while they were dining,
everyone had some fine news to relate. They ask the bride, too, if she
had not something to tell them. She says &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; but that
she cannot tell what she knows&mdash;that it would not please all at
the table. Her husband tells her to speak out boldly; he draws his
sword, and says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whosoever shall speak a word shall be run through with this
sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then tells how a poor girl was servant at a king&rsquo;s house;
how she remained there seven years; that they liked her very much, and
treated her with confidence, even to giving her the keys of the
treasure. One day, when the king and his wife were out, robbers
entered, and stole almost all the treasure. The king would not believe
that robbers had come. He puts the young girl in prison for a whole
year, and at the end of that time he sends her to execution, telling
the executioners to bring her heart to the house. The executioners were
better than the king; they believed in her innocence, and, after having
killed an ass, they carried its heart to the king; &ldquo;and for the
proof, it is I who was servant to this king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bridegroom says to her, &ldquo;Who can this king be? Is it my
uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady says, &ldquo;I do not know if he is your uncle, but it is
that gentleman there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bridegroom takes his sword and kills him on the spot, saying to
his wife,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not be afraid of him any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lived very happily. Some time afterwards they had two children,
a boy and a girl. When the elder was seven years old he died, telling
his father and mother that he was going to Heaven to get a place there
ready for them. At the end of a week the other child dies too, and she
says to them that she, too, is going to Heaven, and that she will keep
their place ready; that they, too, would quickly go to them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>And, as she had said, at the end of a year, at
exactly the very same time, both the gentleman and lady died, and they
both went to Heaven.</p>

<p id="ch6.18">We have four other variations of the above story,
written down, with others, that we heard, but did not copy out. One,
which much resembles the above, excepting in the commencement, opens
with the proposal of a king&rsquo;s son to marry one of the three
daughters of another king. This king asks his three daughters (like
King Lear) how much they love him. The eldest says, &ldquo;As much as I
do my little finger.&rdquo; That did not please him. The second says,
&ldquo;As much as my middle finger.&rdquo; The youngest says, &ldquo;As
much as the bread loves the salt.&rdquo; In a rage the father sends her
into the forest, with two servants, to be killed. They spare her, and
carry the horse&rsquo;s heart to the king, and the girl lives in the
forest &ldquo;on the plants which the birds brought her, and on the
flowers which the bees brought her.&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s son finds
her there while hunting, takes her home, and marries her. At the
wedding feast she gives her father bread without salt, and then
discovers herself, and all is made right, and they live all happily,
except the two sisters, who remain old maids.</p>
<p>Two others open like Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;The King who Wished to
Marry his Daughter.&rdquo; A king loses his wife, who on her deathbed
makes him promise only to marry some one just like her. This is, of
course, her daughter. The daughter will not, and takes counsel of her
godmother. She bids her ask for a wedding dress made of the wings of
flies; but this impossibility is performed. Then the daughter
escapes&mdash;in the one tale in a ship, in the other on foot&mdash;and
takes a place as servant. The king has a ball; the old woman appears,
and gives her the nut with the dresses, etc. But in one of these tales,
on the wedding-day she was more handsomely dressed than ever before,
&ldquo;and think! they had their dresses made for each
other&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, they dress each <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>other! &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how it
is,&rdquo; said the narrator, &ldquo;but the story says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our fifth version is short, and, as it puts the step-mother in an
unusual light, we give it entire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A father and his daughter were living together. The
daughter told her father to marry again. The father said, &ldquo;Why?
you will be unhappy.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is all the same to me; I prefer
to see you happy.&rdquo; And after some time he marries again. This
lady asked her husband to give her full power over this young girl to
do what she will with her. The husband consents, and does not think any
more about her; he did not even see her again. This lady says to the
young girl, &ldquo;If you do all I tell you, you will be the better for
it.&rdquo; The king lived near their house, and one day her step-mother
gave her the keys of the king&rsquo;s house and told her to go at such
an hour of the night into the king&rsquo;s bed-room, &ldquo;and without
waking him you will bring me back his sash.&rdquo; The daughter did not
like it at all, but in spite of that she goes off, and without any
person seeing her, she returns home with the king&rsquo;s girdle. The
next day the step-mother says to her step-daughter, &ldquo;You must go
again, and you must bring the king&rsquo;s watch chain.&rdquo; While
she was taking it, the king moved in his bed, and the young girl is so
frightened that she runs off, and loses her shoe at the door of the
king&rsquo;s room. At the end of some days they hear that the king has
made a proclamation that he will go from house to house with a shoe,
and that she whom it fits perfectly shall be his wife. The king goes
looking and looking, first of all, in the houses of the rich; but he
had said that he would go into all the houses. He goes then to this
gentleman&rsquo;s who had married again, because it was close at hand.
The persons of his suite asked him why he went there, for they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>were only poor people. The king will go all the
same. He finds this lady, who says that they are poor, and that she is
ashamed to receive the king in her bed-room; but it was there she had
her step-daughter very nicely dressed, with only one shoe on her feet.
She was dazzling with beauty, and the king finds her very much to his
taste. They are married immediately; he takes the father and
step-mother to his house, and they all live happily, and this
step-daughter owed her good fortune to her step-mother.</p>

<p class="first">As there are many in the world in its state now, there
was a king who had three daughters. He used continually to bring
handsome presents to his two elder daughters, but did not pay any
attention at all to his youngest daughter, and yet she was the
prettiest and most amiable.</p>
<p>The king kept going from fair to fair, and from feast to feast, and
from everywhere he used to bring something for the two eldest
daughters. One day, when he was going to a feast, he said to his
youngest daughter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never bring anything home for you; tell me then what you
want and you shall have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said to her father: &ldquo;And I do not want
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I am going to bring you something.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, bring me a flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes off, and is busy buying and buying; for one a hat, for the
other a beautiful piece of stuff for a dress, and for the first again a
shawl; and he was returning home, when in passing before a beautiful
castle, he sees a garden quite full of flowers, and he says to
himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! I was going home without a flower for my daughter; here
I shall have plenty of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He takes some then, and as soon as he has done so, a voice says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave you permission to take that flower? As you have
three daughters, if you do not bring me one of them before the year be
finished, you shall be burnt wherever you are&mdash;you, and your whole
kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king goes off home. He gives his elder daughters their presents,
and her nosegay to the youngest. She thanks her father. After a certain
time this king became sad. His eldest daughter said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to her: &ldquo;If one of my daughters will not go to such a
spot before the end of the year, I shall be burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eldest daughter answers him, &ldquo;Be burned if you like; as
for me, I shall not go. I have no wish at all to go there. Settle it
with the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second also asks him, &ldquo;You seem very sad, papa; what is
the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told her how he is bound to send one of his daughters to such a
place before the end of the year, otherwise he should be burned.</p>
<p>This one too says to him, &ldquo;Manage your own business as you
like, but do not reckon upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngest, after some days, said to him, &ldquo;What is the
matter with you, my father, that you are so sad? Has someone done you
some hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said to her, &ldquo;When I went to get your nosegay, a voice said
to me, &lsquo;I must have one of your daughters <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>before the year be completed,&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5385src" href="#xd26e5385" name=
"xd26e5385src">83</a> and now I do not know what I must do. It told me
that I shall be burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This daughter said to him, &ldquo;My father, do not be troubled
about it. I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she sets out immediately in a carriage. She arrives at the
castle and goes in, and she hears music and sounds of rejoicing
everywhere, and yet she did not see anyone. She finds her chocolate
ready (in the morning), and her dinner the same. She goes to bed, and
still she does not see anyone. The next morning a voice says to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your eyes; I wish to place my head on your knees for a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come; I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There appears then an enormous serpent. Without intending it, the
young lady could not help giving a little shudder. An instant after the
serpent went away; and the young lady lived very happily, without
lacking anything. One day the voice asked her if she did not wish to go
home.</p>
<p>She answers, &ldquo;I am very happy here. I have no longing for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like, you may go for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives her a ring, and says to her, &ldquo;If that changes colour,
I shall be ill, and if it turns to blood, I shall be in great
misery.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5405src" href="#xd26e5405"
name="xd26e5405src">84</a></p>
<p>The young lady sets out for her father&rsquo;s house. Her father was
very glad (to see her). Her sisters said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be happy there. You are prettier than you were
before. With whom do you live there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told them, &ldquo;With a serpent.&rdquo; They would not believe
her. The three days flew by like a dream, and she forgot her serpent.
The fourth day she looked at her ring, and she saw that it was changed.
She rubs it with her finger, and it begins to bleed. Seeing that she
goes running <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>to her father, and says to him that she is
going. She arrives at the castle, and finds everything sad. The music
will not play&mdash;everything was shut up. She called the serpent (his
name was Azor, and hers Fifine). She kept on calling and crying out to
him, but Azor appeared nowhere. After having searched the whole house,
after having taken off her shoes, she goes to the garden, and there too
she cries out. She finds a corner of the earth in the garden quite
frozen, and immediately she makes a great fire over this spot, and
there Azor comes out, and he says to her:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5418src" href="#xd26e5418" name="xd26e5418src">85</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You had forgotten me, then. If you had not made this fire, it
would have been all up with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifine said to him, &ldquo;Yes, I had forgotten you, but the ring
made me think of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azor said to her, &ldquo;I knew what was going to happen; that is
why I gave you the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And coming into the house, she finds it as before, all full of
rejoicings&mdash;the music was playing on all sides. Some days after
that Azor said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifine gives no answer. He asks her again like that three times, and
still she remained silent, silent. The whole house becomes sad again.
She has no more her meals ready. Again Azor asks her if she will marry
him. Still she does not answer, and she remains like that in darkness
several days without eating anything, and she said to herself,
&ldquo;Whatever it shall cost me I must say, Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the serpent asks her again, &ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo;
she answers, &ldquo;Not with the serpent, but with the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she had said that the music begins as before. Azor says
to her that she must go to her father&rsquo;s house and get all things
ready that are necessary, and they will marry the next day. The young
lady goes as he had told her. She says to her father that she is going
to be married to the serpent to-morrow, (and asks him) if he will
prepare everything for that. The father consents, but he is vexed. Her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>sisters, too, ask her whom she is going to
marry, and they are astounded at hearing that it is with a serpent.
Fifine goes back again, and Azor says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which would you prefer, from the house to the church,
serpent, or from the church to the house, (serpent)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifine says to him, &ldquo;From the house to the church,
serpent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azor says to her, &ldquo;I, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A beautiful carriage comes to the door. The serpent gets in, and
Fifine places herself at his side, and when they arrive at the
king&rsquo;s house the serpent says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut the doors and the curtains, that nobody may
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifine says to him, &ldquo;But they will see you as you get
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter; shut them all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She goes to her father. Her father comes with all his court to fetch
the serpent. He opens the door, and who is astonished? Why, everybody.
Instead of a serpent there is a charming young man; and they all go to
the church. When they come out there is a grand dinner at the
king&rsquo;s, but the bridegroom says to his wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day we must not make a feast at all. We have a great
business to do in the house; we will come another day for the
feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told that to her father, and they go on to their house. When
they are come there her husband brings her in a large basket a
serpent&rsquo;s skin, and says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will make a great fire, and when you hear the first
stroke of midnight you will throw this serpent&rsquo;s skin into the
fire. That must be burnt up, and you must throw the ashes out of window
before the last stroke of twelve has ceased striking. If you do not do
that I shall be wretched for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady says to him, &ldquo;Certainly; I will do everything that I
can to succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She begins before midnight to make the fire. As soon as she heard
the first stroke she throws the serpent&rsquo;s skin <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>(on
the fire), and takes two spits and stirs the fire, and moves about the
skin and burns it, till ten strokes have gone. Then she takes a shovel,
and throws the ashes outside as the last twelfth stroke is ending. Then
a terrible voice says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I curse your cleverness, and what you have just
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time her husband comes in. He did not know where he was
for joy. He kisses her, and does not know how to tell his wife what
great good she has done him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I do not fear anything. If you had not done as I told
you, I should have been enchanted for twenty-one years more. Now it is
all over, and we will go at our ease to-morrow to your father&rsquo;s
house for the wedding feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go the next day and enjoy themselves very much. They return to
their palace to take away the handsomest things, because they did not
wish to stop any more in that corner of the mountain. They load all
their valuable things in carts and waggons, and go to live with the
king. This young lady has four children, two boys and two girls, and as
her sisters were very jealous of her, their father sent them out of the
house. The king gave his crown to his son-in-law, who was already a son
of a king. As they had lived well, they died well too.</p>

<p id="ch6.21">We have another version of this tale, which is a little
more like its prototype, the &ldquo;Cupid and Psyche&rdquo; of
Apuleius. In this the monster comes only at night. At first she is
horribly frightened at it, but little by little she becomes accustomed
to it, and loves it. At last, after having been left alone for some
days, a magnificent young man appears to her, a king&rsquo;s son, who
had been bewitched into the monster until some one should love him. Of
course they marry and are happy.</p>

<h4 class="main">The Cobbler and his Three Daughters (Blue Beard).</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a cobbler who
had three daughters. They were very poor. He only earned enough just to
feed his children. He did not know what would become of him. He went
about in his grief, walking, walking sadly on, and he meets a
gentleman, who asks him where he is going, melancholy like that. He
answers him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if I shall tell you, I shall get no relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; who knows? Tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have three daughters, and I have not work enough to
maintain them. I have famine in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is only that, we will manage it. You will give me one
of your daughters, and I will give you so much money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father was very grieved to make any such bargain; but at last he
comes down to that. He gives him his eldest daughter. This gentleman
takes her to his palace, and, after having passed some time there, he
said to her that he has a short journey to make&mdash;that he will
leave her all the keys, that she might see everything, but that there
is one key that she must not make use of&mdash;that it would bring
misfortune on her. He locks the door on the young lady. This young girl
goes into all the rooms, and finds them very beautiful, and she was
curious to see what there was in that which was forbidden. She goes in,
and sees heaps of dead bodies. Judge of her fright! With her trembling
she lets the key fall upon the ground. She trembles for the coming of
her husband. He arrives, and asks her if she has entered the forbidden
chamber. She tells him &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He takes her and puts her
into an underground dungeon; hardly, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>hardly did he give
her enough to eat (to live on), and that was human flesh.</p>
<p>This cobbler had finished his money, and he was again melancholy.
The gentleman meets him again, and says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your other daughter is not happy alone; you must give me
another daughter. When she is happy, I will send her back; and I will
give you so much money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father did not like it; but he was so poor that, in order to
have a little money, he gives him his daughter. The gentleman takes her
home with him, like the other. After some days he said to her too,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take a short journey. I will give you all the keys of
the house, but do not touch such a key of such a room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He locks the house-door, and goes off, after having left her the
food she needed. This young girl goes into all the rooms, and, as she
was curious, she went to look into the forbidden chamber. She was so
terribly frightened at the sight of so many dead bodies in this room,
that she lets the key fall, and it gets stained. Our young girl was
trembling as to what should become of her when the master should come
back. He arrives, and the first thing he asks&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been in that room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He takes her underground, like her
other sister.</p>
<p>This cobbler had finished his money, and he was in misery; when the
gentleman comes to him again, and says to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you a great deal of money if you will let your
daughter come to my house for a few days; the three will be happier
together, and I will send you the two back again together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father believes it, and gives him his third daughter. The
gentleman gives him the money, and he takes this young girl, like the
others. At the end of some days he leaves her, saying that he is going
to make a short journey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>He gives her all the keys of the
house, saying to her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go into all the rooms except this one,&rdquo;
pointing out the key to her. He locks the outside door, and goes off.
This young girl goes straight, straight to the forbidden chamber; she
opens it, and think of her horror at seeing so many dead people. She
thought that he would kill her too, and, as there were all kinds of
arms in this chamber, she takes a sabre with her, and hides it under
her dress. She goes a little further on, and sees her two sisters
almost dying with hunger, and a young man in the same condition. She
takes care of them as well as she can till the gentleman comes home. On
his arrival, he asks her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been in that room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She says, &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; and, in giving him back the keys, she
lets them fall on the ground, on purpose, and at the instant that this
gentleman stoops to pick them up, the young lady cuts off his head
(with her sword). Oh, how glad she was! Quickly she runs to deliver her
sisters and that young man, who was the son of a king. She sends for
her father, the cobbler, and leaves him there with his two daughters,
and the youngest daughter goes away with her young gentleman, after
being married to him. If they lived well, they died well too.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p id="ch6.23">In another version, by Estefanella Hirigaray, we have
the more ordinary tale of &ldquo;Blue Beard&rdquo;&mdash;that of a
widower who has killed twenty wives, and marries a twenty-first, who
has two brothers. She drops the key in the forbidden chamber, and is
detected by the blood on it. She manages to write to her brothers, and
the dialogue by which she endeavours to gain time is rather spirited.
She is allowed to put on her wedding-dress, etc., to die in. She goes
to get ready, and she hears the cries of her husband, &ldquo;Are you
ready?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am putting on my dress.&rdquo; He bawls out
again, &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me a moment
more.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am fastening my
dress.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you ready yet?&rdquo; &ldquo;I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>am
putting on my stockings.&rdquo; And she kept constantly looking out of
window to see if her brothers were coming. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stop one moment; I am putting on my shoes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you
ready?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am brushing my hair.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you
ready?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me put on my wreath.&rdquo; And she sees her
brothers coming on horseback in the forest, but a very long way off.
She hears again, &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am coming in an
instant.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are coming? <i>I</i>&rsquo;ll come, if you
do not come down.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come; I will come down
myself, without you.&rdquo; He seizes her on the stairs to kill her;
but the brothers rush in just in time to prevent her death, and they
put him in prison.</p>
<p>We heard, also, another version, which, unfortunately, we did not
take down. It had something about a horse in it, and was like
&ldquo;The Widow and her Daughters,&rdquo; in Campbell, Vol. II., Tale
xli., p. 265.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">The Singing Tree, the Bird which tells the Truth, and
the Water that makes Young.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there were three young
girls. They were spinning together, and as girls must always talk about
something while they are spinning, the eldest said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not guess what I am thinking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it us, tell it us,&rdquo; (said the other two).</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I should like to be married to the king&rsquo;s
valet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I with his son-in-law,&rdquo; said the second.</p>
<p>And the third said: &ldquo;And I with the king himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, the king lived not far from these girls, and just at that
moment he was passing before the door of their house, and heard what
they said. The next day the king asked the eldest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you saying yesterday at such a time?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>And she was ashamed to tell him, but the king pressed her so much
that at last she told it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said that I wished to be married to your
servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made the second come, and asked her the same question:
&ldquo;What were you talking about yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would not tell; but the king pressed her so much that she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was saying that I wished to marry your
son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sends them back home, and sends for the third, and asks her what
she said the evening before. She never dared to tell it, because that
would have been too great an impudence, but at the last she told it
him; and the king told her that they must really be married together,
because she was so very pretty. This young girl goes running off home.
She told her sisters that she is to marry the king, and all three go to
live in the king&rsquo;s house. The two sisters were very jealous. The
princess became in the family-way; and the king was obliged to go to
another kingdom. His poor wife was confined of a fine girl. But her
sisters made the queen believe that she had given birth to a cat, and
they wrote this too to the king. The king wrote back to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it be a cat, take all possible care of it.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5585src" href="#xd26e5585" name=
"xd26e5585src">86</a></p>
<p>When the king returned he did not mention the cat at all. She became
pregnant a second time, and the king was obliged to go to another
kingdom, and when the princess was confined her sisters made her
believe that she had given birth to a dog. Think what grief and pain
this poor queen suffered. Her sisters wrote to the king that his wife
had given birth to a dog, and that without doubt she had something to
do with animals. He wrote again: &ldquo;If it be a dog, take all
possible care of it.&rdquo; But they said that they had already thrown
it into the water, as they had done with the cat.</p>
<p>Fortunately a gardener was there, the same that had been there the
first time. He caught hold of the basket, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>finds a beautiful child inside. He is very glad,
and carries the child to his wife, who puts the infant out to
nurse.</p>
<p>The princess became pregnant the third time. The king had intended
to stop at home; but at the moment of the confinement he was obliged to
go away somewhere, and the sisters wrote to the king that she had been
confined of a bear. The king flew into a great rage, and ordered her to
be put into a dungeon underground. They gave her a little food through
a hole, so that she might not die of starvation; and nevertheless she
had given birth to a handsome boy. The same gardener found this basket
too, which they had thrown into the water. He carries it to his wife,
and she gave it to the same nurse. They were very happy with it, and
said that Heaven had sent them these three children, and they loved
their father and mother very much; but when they were very old they
both died.</p>
<p>The two brothers and their sister got on very well together. They
loved each other very much. The boys used to go out hunting and
shooting, and they were so well off that they had something to give to
the poor. One day there came an old woman begging, and she said to
them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we certainly are,&rdquo; they answered.</p>
<p>And the woman said to them: &ldquo;No, no, you want three things
before you can be happy&mdash;the tree which sings, the bird which
tells the truth, and the water which makes young again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl grows sad at that. Her brothers remarked it
immediately, and they asked her what was the matter with her. But she
would not tell them. At last they forced her to tell it to them. She
told them what this woman had told her.</p>
<p>The elder of the brothers sets out immediately, taking with him a
horse and a little money. He gives an apple to his sister, saying to
her:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5609src" href="#xd26e5609" name=
"xd26e5609src">87</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If this apple changes I shall be in some trouble, and if it
turns rotten I shall be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he starts off, and travels on, and on, and on. He finds a monk
who tells him to retrace his steps, that there are great dangers before
him; but he will go on notwithstanding. He meets again another monk,
who tells him that he will never return. He confesses himself and
prepares for death, such great dangers will he have to pass through. He
said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will hear terrible cries. It will seem to you as if they
will pull you by your clothes, but never turn your head
round.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5621src" href="#xd26e5621"
name="xd26e5621src">88</a></p>
<p>But our lad grew frightened and turned his head round, and was
changed into stone.</p>
<p>After some days the apple begins to get bad, and they fall into
great sorrow because something must have happened to their brother, and
the second brother said that he must go off too; and off he goes with a
horse and a little money. Like the other brother he meets a monk, who
wishes to stop him; but he said to him that it was all the same to him.
He goes on till he meets another monk. This one also said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Return on your steps. You will not be able to pass; you will
hear cries and see horrors and terrible things&mdash;you will never be
able to pass through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he prepares himself to go forward. He warned him well not to
look round. He leaves his horse and sets out. When he has gone a short
distance he hears frightful cries, and (sees) terrible things; and
after having gone some distance further he looks on one side, and is
changed into stone.</p>
<p>The apple which he had left with his sister first changes, then goes
quite rotten. You may judge of the sorrow and the grief of this poor
girl. She says to herself that she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180"
href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>must dress herself like a
man. She locks the door (of their house), and sets out on horseback.
The same monk wishes to prevent her going on. But she has a still
greater desire to do so, and, notwithstanding all she hears, she will
go on. She arrives at the last monk, who was a great saint. He did not
recognise that it was a young girl. For a hundred years past he had
been on the same spot, until someone should get to the end of the
mountain, and he hoped that this young girl might pass. He gives her a
bottle into which she might put the water that makes young again, and
says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will sprinkle one drop on each stone, and they will
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sets off. The horrible cries did not frighten her. All kinds of
things were said to her. She goes on and on, constantly running, and
gets to the top of the mountain, and she is saved.</p>
<p>At the same instant she hears a thrilling song from a tree, which
was warbling like a bird. A bird, too, flies on to her shoulder, and
tells her so many things that she is quite astounded. But she does not
lose her time&mdash;she takes out her bottle and fills it with water.
She pours a drop on each stone, and finds her brothers at last. Think,
think how they all three rejoiced together! They take their horses
(they too had been changed into stones) and go home with their tree,
and the bird, and the water.</p>
<p>They lived very happily. The brothers went out hunting every day,
and sometimes they met the king. One day the king invited them to dine
with him, but they said that they must first ask permission of their
sister. When they came home they asked her, and the bird answered
immediately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On condition that the king will come here
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They go with this answer to the king, and he says,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dine very well with the king, but their sister was not at all
pleased; she did not know how to receive the king. The bird says to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay the table with a fine cloth, and three dishes; put
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>lentils into one, parched peas into the other,
and haricot beans into the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day the king comes with his two brothers. The king is
astonished to hear this beautiful tree and this fine singing. He had
never heard anything so wonderful. He was surprised to see these three
dishes, and he said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not strange to receive a king like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the bird, hopping out of its cage, begins, &ldquo;It is not more
strange than to see this young woman pass for a cat. <i>Is she a
cat?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same way it points to the elder brother, &ldquo;<i>Is this a
dog</i>, this young man? Is not this a thing more
astonishing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king is confounded. And the same thing for the third time,
pointing to the second son, &ldquo;<i>Is this a bear, this one?</i> Is
this not an astonishing thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king, in his amazement, does not know what to answer to the
bird; but it continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not a shame to leave one&rsquo;s wife, and make her
live eighteen years in a dungeon underground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king is terribly frightened, and off he goes with his sons and
his daughter, intending to free their mother; but they did not forget
the precious water, and they wash this princess in it, and she becomes
as young as at eighteen years old. Judge of the joy of the king, of the
queen, and of their children! The king fell into a great rage, and
condemns the queen&rsquo;s sisters to be burnt alive in the midst of
the market-place, with shirts of sulphur on them.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">Catherine Elizondo.</span></p>
<hr class="tb">
<p id="ch6.25">We have also the more common version of this
story&mdash;of an aged king with three sons. He reads of this water,
and the three sons successively set out to fetch it. The two first
fail, and stop, drinking, &amp;c., in a certain city. The youngest
meets an old woman, who tells him how to charm all the beasts in a
forest he has to pass through, and how <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>to get the water, but
he is not to take anything else. But he steals the bird, and the magic
horse as well, and when he gets to the forest finds all the animals
awake. The old woman appears again, and gives him a magic stick, with
the aid of which he passes. He finds his brothers against the advice of
the old lady, and they throw him into a pit and take away the water,
the horse, and the bird; but the water has no effect in their hands.
The old woman appears, and sends a fox to help him out of the pit. He
comes home, the horse neighs, the bird sings, he gives the water to his
father, and from one hundred years old he becomes twenty.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">The White Blackbird.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a king who
had three sons. This king was blind, and he had heard one day that
there was a king who had a white blackbird, which gave sight to the
blind. When his eldest son heard that, he said to his father that he
would go and fetch this white blackbird as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The father said to him, &ldquo;I prefer to remain blind rather than
to separate myself from you, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son says to him, &ldquo;Have no fear for me; with a horse laden
with money I will find it and bring it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes off then, far, far, far away. When night came he stopped.
One evening he stopped at an inn where there were three very beautiful
young ladies. They said to him that they must have a game of cards
together. He refuses; but after many prayers and much pressing they
begin. He loses all his money, his horse, and also has a large debt
against his word of honour. In this country it was the custom for
persons who did not pay their debts to be put in prison, and if they
did not pay after a given time they were put to death, and then
afterwards they were left <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>at the church doors until someone
should pay their debts.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5708src" href=
"#xd26e5708" name="xd26e5708src">89</a> They therefore put this
king&rsquo;s son in prison.</p>
<p>The second son, seeing that his brother did not return, said to his
father that he wished to go off, (and asked him) to give him a horse
and plenty of money, and that certainly he would not lose his time. He
sets off, and, as was fated to occur, he goes to the inn where his
brother had been ruined. After supper these young ladies say to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have a game of cards with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He refuses, but these young ladies cajole him so well, and turn him
round their fingers, that he ends by consenting. They begin then, and
he also loses all his money, his horse, and makes a great many debts
besides. They put him in prison like his brother.</p>
<p>After some time the king and his youngest son are in deep grief
because some misfortune must have happened to them, and the youngest
asks leave to set out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you that I will do something. Have no anxiety on my
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This poor father lets him go off, but not with a good will. He kept
saying to him that he would prefer to be always blind; but the son
would set off. His father gives him a beautiful horse, and as much gold
as his horse could carry, and his crown. He goes off far, far, far
away. They rested every night, and he happened, like his brothers, to
go to the same inn. After supper these young ladies say to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the custom for everyone to play at cards
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says that it is not for him, and that he will not play. The young
ladies beg him ever so much, but they do not succeed with this one in
any fashion whatever. They cannot make him play. The next morning he
gets up early, takes his horse, and goes off. He sees that they are
leading <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>two men to death. He asks what they have done,
and recognises his two brothers. They tell him that they have not paid
their debts within the appointed time, and that they must be put to
death. But he pays the debts of both, and goes on. Passing before the
church he sees that they are doing something. He asks what it is. They
tell him that it is a man who has left some debts, and that until
someone pays them he will be left there still. He pays the debts
again.</p>
<p>He goes on his journey, and arrives at last at the king&rsquo;s
house where the blackbird was. Our king&rsquo;s son asks if they have
not a white blackbird which restores sight. They tell him,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Our young gentleman relates how that his father is
blind, and that he has come such a long way to fetch it to him.</p>
<p>The king says to him, &ldquo;I will give you this white blackbird,
when you shall have brought me from the house of such a king a young
lady who is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young man goes off far, far, far away. When he is near the
king&rsquo;s house a fox<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5738src" href=
"#xd26e5738" name="xd26e5738src">90</a> comes out and says to him,
&ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answers, &ldquo;I want a young lady from the king&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives his horse to the fox to take care of, and the fox says to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go to such a room; there will be the young lady whom
you need. You will not recognise her because she has old clothes on,
but there are beautiful dresses hanging up in the room. You will make
her put on one of those. As soon as she shall have it on, she will
begin to sing and will wake up everybody in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes inside as the fox had told him. He finds the young lady. He
makes her put on the beautiful dresses, and as soon as she has them on
she begins to sing and to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>carol. Everyone rushes into this
young lady&rsquo;s room. The king in a rage wished to put him in
prison, but the king&rsquo;s son shows his crown, and tells how such a
king sent him to fetch this young lady, and when once he has brought
her he promises him the white blackbird to open his father&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>The king then says to him, &ldquo;You must go to the house of such a
king, and you must bring me from there a white horse, which is very,
very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our young man sets out, and goes on, and on, and on. As he comes
near the house of the king, the fox appears to him and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse which you want is in such a place, but he has a bad
saddle on. You will put on him that which is hanging up, and which is
handsome and brilliant. As soon as he shall have it on he will begin to
neigh, so much as not to be able to stop.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5766src" href="#xd26e5766" name="xd26e5766src">91</a> All the
king&rsquo;s people will come to see what is happening, but with your
crown you will always get off scot free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes off as the fox had said to him. He finds the horse with the
bad saddle, and puts on him the fine one, and then the horse begins to
neigh and cannot stop himself. People arrive, and they wish to put the
young man in prison, but he shows them his crown, and relates what king
had sent him to fetch this horse in order to get a young lady. They
give him the horse, and he sets off.</p>
<p>He comes to the house of the king where the young lady was. He shows
his horse with its beautiful saddle, and asks the king if he would not
like to see the young lady take a few turns on this beautiful horse in
the courtyard. The king says, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; As the young lady was
very handsomely dressed when she mounted the horse, our young man gives
the horse a little touch with his stick, and they set off like the
lightning. The king&rsquo;s son follows them, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>they
go both together to the king who had the white blackbird. They ask him
for the blackbird, and the bird goes of itself on to the knees of the
young lady, who was still on horseback. The king&rsquo;s son gives him
a blow, and they set off at full gallop; he also escapes in order to
rejoin them. They journey a long, long time, and approach their
city.</p>
<p>His brothers had heard the news how that their brother was coming
with the white blackbird. These two brothers had come back at last to
their father&rsquo;s house, and they had told their father a hundred
falsehoods; how that robbers had taken away their money, and many
things like that. The two brothers plotted together, and said that they
must hinder their brother from reaching the house, and that they must
rob him of the blackbird.</p>
<p>They keep expecting him always. One day they saw him coming, and
they say that they must throw him into a cistern,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5781src" href="#xd26e5781" name="xd26e5781src">92</a> and they do
as they say. They take the blackbird and throw him and the lady into
the water, and leave the horse outside. The fox comes to them on the
brink of the cistern, and says to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will leap in there; you will take hold of my tail one by
one, and I will save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two wicked brothers had taken the blackbird, but he escaped from
them as they entered the house, and went on to the white horse. Judge
of the joy of the youngest brother when he sees that nothing is wanting
to them! They go to the king. As soon as they enter the young lady
begins to carol and to sing, the bird too, and the horse to neigh. The
blackbird of its own accord goes on to the king&rsquo;s knees, and
there by its songs restored him to sight. The son relates to his father
what labours he underwent until he had found these three things, and he
told him how he had saved two men condemned to death by paying their
debts, and that they were his two brothers; that he had also paid the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>debts of a dead man, and that his soul (the fox
was his soul) had saved him from the cistern into which his brothers
had thrown him.</p>
<p>Think of the joy of the father, and his sorrow at the same time,
when he saw how wisely this young son had always behaved, and how
wicked his two brothers had been. As he had well earned her, he was
married to the young lady whom he had brought away with him, and they
lived happily and joyfully. The father sent the two brothers into the
desert to do penance. If they had lived well, they would have died
well.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">The Sister and her Seven Brothers.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a man and a woman very poor, and
over-burdened with children. They had seven boys. When they had grown
up a little, they said to their mother that it would be better that
they should go on their own way&mdash;that they would get on better
like that. The mother let them go with great regret. After their
departure she gave birth to a little girl, and when this little girl
was grown up a little she went one day to a neighbor&rsquo;s to amuse
herself, and having played some childish trick the neighbor said to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be a good one, you too, as your brothers have
been.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="n187.1src" href="#n187.1" name=
"n187.1src">93</a></p>
<p>The child goes home and says to her mother, &ldquo;Mother, have I
some brothers?&rdquo;<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n187.1">93</a></p>
<p>The mother says, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gone off somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daughter said to her, &ldquo;I must go too, then. Give me a
piece of linen enough to make seven shirts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she <i>would</i> go off at once. The mother was very sorry for
it, having already seven children away from home, and the only one she
had wished to go away. She let her go then. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>This young girl went off, far, far, far away. She asks in a town if
they know seven brothers who work together. They tell her
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She goes off to a mountain and asks there too, and
they tell her in what house they live. She goes to this house, and sees
that all the household work is to be done, and that there is nobody at
home. She makes the beds, and cleans the whole house, and puts it in
order. She prepares the dinner, and then hides herself in the
dust-hole. Her brothers come home, and are astonished to see all the
household work done and the dinner ready. They begin to look if there
is anyone in the house, but they never think of looking in the
dust-hole, and they go off again to their work. Before night this young
girl does all the rest of the work, and had the supper ready against
the return of her brothers, and hides herself again in the dust-hole.
Her brothers are astonished, and again search the house, but find
nothing.</p>
<p>They go to bed, and this young girl takes to sewing and sews a whole
shirt. She gives it to her eldest brother, and in the same way she made
a shirt every night, and took it to one of her brothers. They could not
understand how that all happened. They always said that they would not
go to sleep, but they fell asleep as soon as they were in bed. When the
turn of the youngest came to have the shirt, he said to them,
&ldquo;Certainly I will not fall asleep.&rdquo; After he is in bed the
young girl goes and says to him, thinking that he is asleep:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your turn has come now at last, my dearly loved
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she begins to put the shirt on him on the bed, when her brother
says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are then my sister, you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he kisses her. She tells him then how she had heard that she had
brothers, and how she had wished to go to them to help them. The other
brothers get up and rejoice, learning that it was their sister who had
done all the household work. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>The brothers forbad her ever to go to such a neighbour&rsquo;s,
whatever might happen. But one day, without thinking about it, when she
was behindhand with her work, she went running to the house to ask for
some fire,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5839src" href="#xd26e5839" name=
"xd26e5839src">94</a> in order to make the supper ready quicker. She
was very well received; the woman offered to give her everything she
wanted, but she said she was satisfied with a little fire. This woman
was a witch, and gives her a parcel of herbs, telling her to put them
as they were into the footbath&mdash;that they relieved the fatigue
very much.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5842src" href="#xd26e5842" name=
"xd26e5842src">95</a> Every evening the seven brothers washed their
feet at the same time in a large copper. She therefore put these herbs
into the copper, and as soon as they had dipped their feet in they
became six cows, and the seventh a Breton cow.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5847src" href="#xd26e5847" name="xd26e5847src">96</a> This poor
girl was in such trouble as cannot be told. The poor cows all used to
kiss their sister, but the young girl always loved much best the Breton
one. Every day she took them to the field, and stopped with them to
guard them.</p>
<p>One day when she was there the son of a king passes by, and is quite
astonished to see so beautiful a girl there. He speaks to her, and
tells her that he wishes to marry her. The young girl says to him that
she is very poor, and that that cannot be. The king says, &ldquo;Yes,
yes, yes, that makes no difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl makes as conditions that, if she marries him, he must
never kill these cows, and especially this little Breton one.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5856src" href="#xd26e5856" name=
"xd26e5856src">97</a> The king promises it her, and they are married.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>The princess takes these cows home with her; they were always well
treated. The princess became pregnant, and was confined while the king
was absent. The witch comes, and takes her out of her bed, and throws
her down a precipice that there was in the king&rsquo;s grounds, and
the witch puts herself into the princess&rsquo; bed. When the king
comes home, he finds her very much changed, and tells her that he would
not have recognised her. The princess tells him that it was her
sufferings that had made her thus, and, in order to cure her more
quickly, he must have the Breton cow killed.</p>
<p>The king says to her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Did you not make me promise that she should never be
killed? How is it you ask me that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witch considered that one her greatest enemy; and, as she left
him no peace, he sent a servant to fetch the cows. He finds them all
seven by the precipice; they were lowing, and he tried to drive them to
the house, but he could not do it in any way; and he hears a voice,
which says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for myself that I grieve so much, but for my child,
and for my husband, and for my dearly-loved cows. Who will take care of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad could not succeed (in driving them), and goes and tells to
the king what is taking place. The king himself goes to the precipice,
and hears this voice. He quickly throws a long cord down, and, when he
thinks that she has had time to take hold of it, he pulls it up, and
sees that they have got the princess there. Judge of the joy of the
king! She relates to her husband all that the witch had done to her,
both formerly and now. The king goes to the witch&rsquo;s bed, and says
to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know your villanies now; and, if you do not immediately
change these cows, as they were before, into fine boys, I will put you
into a red-hot oven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witch makes them fine men, and, notwithstanding that, the king
had her burnt in a red-hot oven, and threw her ashes into the air. The
king lived happily with his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>wife, and her seven brothers
married ladies of the court, and sent for their mother, and they all
lived happily together.</p>

<p id="ch6.28">We have also, in Basque, a version of Madame
d&rsquo;Aulnoy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abenan.&rdquo; It seems to be a mixture
of various legends strung together by this fanciful writer; but we do
not think it worth either our own or our readers&rsquo; while to try to
disentangle its separate parts. The pretty little tale of &ldquo;The
Faded Roses&rdquo; has been told us from two quite different sources.
This tale, though without doubt derived from the French, we can trace
up in Basque further than any other. It was told us by a lady of
between seventy and eighty, who heard it as a child from an old nurse,
whom she distinctly remembers to have told her that <i>she</i> learnt
it as a child from her mother. It must thus have existed in Basque over
a century.</p>
<p>We have also two versions of Tom Thumb, who is called in the one
&ldquo;Ukhailtcho,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Baratchuri&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;a
clove of garlic;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5892src" href=
"#xd26e5892" name="xd26e5892src">98</a> in the other,
&ldquo;Mundua-mila-pes,&rdquo; both containing the episode of his being
swallowed by an ox; in the last, he himself is swallowed, as they are
washing out the ox&rsquo; entrails, by &ldquo;a thief of a
dog&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oho&ntilde; chakhurra.&rdquo; It is singular
that the same episode is preserved in the Gaelic; <i>cf.</i> Campbell,
Vol. III., p. 114.</p>
<p>We have in MS. a long Rabelesian legend, which opens like
Cenac-Moncaut&rsquo;s tale of &ldquo;Le Coffret de la Princesse,&rdquo;
in his &ldquo;Litt&eacute;rature Populaire de la Gascogne&rdquo;
(Paris, 1868). A king will give one of his daughters to whoever can
guess what the skin of a certain animal is. It is the devil who guesses
it, and who marries the princess. She is saved by the &ldquo;white
mare,&rdquo; which appears in so many of our tales. She then dresses as
a man, but, nevertheless, a prince falls in love with her; and then
follow a lot of scenes, the converse of the adventure of Achilles in
Scyros. They marry; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192"
name="pb192">192</a>]</span>but, after seven years, the devil-husband
reappears. After strange adventures, they are again succoured and
united by the &ldquo;white mare,&rdquo; who binds the devil for ever,
and then flies to heaven as a white pigeon, and the rest live happily
ever after. This legend is from &ldquo;Laurentine, Sister of
Toutou,&rdquo; and may be mingled with Cascarrot legends. We have given
it as derived from the French, partly because the heroine&rsquo;s name
is Fifine, and because this, and &ldquo;Petit Perroquet and the
Tartaro,&rdquo; are the only tales in our collection in which the term
&ldquo;prince&rdquo; is employed in the Basque instead of &ldquo;the
king&rsquo;s son.&rdquo; <i>Cf.</i> Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Highland
Tales,&rdquo; <i>passim</i>.</p>

<p id="ch6.bibl">We owe the following notes to the kindness of M. H.
Vinson, Judge at La R&eacute;ole, Gironde. They may be of assistance to
some of our readers in the endeavour to trace out the length of time
which is required for the translations of exotic legends to become
popular traditions among a people who know the language of the
translation only by &ldquo;social contact.&rdquo;</p>

I saw the Gaelic tale that it struck me that it is simply &ldquo;Jean
d&rsquo;Ecosse&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;John of Scotland,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Scotch John.&rdquo; In the analogous tale in Campbell,
&ldquo;The Barra Widow&rsquo;s Son,&rdquo; Vol. II., p. 111, we
read&mdash;&ldquo;It was Iain Albanach&rdquo; (literally, Jean
d&rsquo;Ecosse) &ldquo;the boy was called at first; he gave him the
name of Iain Mac a Maighstir&rdquo; (John, master&rsquo;s son)
&ldquo;because he himself was master of the vessel.&rdquo; This seems
decisive that in some way the Basques have borrowed this tale from the
Kelts since their occupation of the Hebrides. The Spanish versions,
too, are termed &ldquo;The Irish Princess&rdquo; (Patra&ntilde;as, p.
234).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e4892src">&uarr;</a></p>

either in the shape of a hermit or a <i>fox</i>. In the Gaelic it is
left vague and undetermined. He is called &ldquo;one,&rdquo; or

put this tale aside, with some others, as worthless, until we found
from Campbell how widely it is spread. The earliest version seems to be
the Italian of Straparola, 1567. The first incident there, persuading
that a pig is an ass, we have in another Basque tale; the last two
incidents are identical. They are found, too, in the Gaelic,</p>
though in separate versions. For killing the wife, see Campbell, Vol.
II., p. 232; for the last, pp. 222 and 234. <i>Cf.</i> also &ldquo;The
Three Widows,&rdquo; with all the variations and notes, Vol. II., pp.
218&ndash;238. Is this a case of transmission from one people to
another of the Italian of Straparola? or do all the versions point back
to some lost original? and is there, or can there be, any allegorical
meaning to such a tale? The answer to these questions seems of great
importance, and the present tale to be a good instance to work upon.
Petarillo seems an Italian name.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main">VII.&mdash;Religious Tales.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We give these tales simply as specimens of a
literature which in medi&aelig;val times rivalled in popularity and
interest all other kinds of literature put together. That even yet it
is not without attraction, and that to minds which in some aspects seem
most opposed to its influence, the preface of the late Charles Kingsley
to &ldquo;The Hermits&rdquo; conclusively shows. Such tales have, too,
a deeper interest to all who study the manner in which at a certain
stage of intellectual cultivation the human mind seems alone able to
take hold upon religious truth; or, at least, the side on which it is
then most susceptible to its impressions. It is easy enough to laugh at
these legends, and to throw them aside in contempt, as alternately
irreverent or superstitious; but their very existence has an historical
value which no ecclesiastical historian should neglect. Their grossness
and rudeness to a great extent hide from us their real tenderness and
true religious feeling; but they were, doubtless, to those who first
heard them, and are still to those who now recite them, fully as
instructive, and have quite as beneficial, purifying, and ennobling
influence on them as the most polished and refined of the religious
tales of the present day have on the young of our own generation.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a mother and
her son. The lad was as strong as fourteen men together, but he was
also obliged to eat as much as fourteen men. They were poor, and on
that account he often suffered from hunger. He said one day to his
mother, that it would be better for him to try and go somewhere else to
see if he could be any better off; that he could not bear it any longer
like this; that he was pained to see how much it cost her to feed
him.</p>
<p>The mother with regret allows him to depart. He goes off then far,
far, far away, and comes to a large house. He asks if they want a
servant there, and they answer that they will speak to the master. The
master himself comes and says to him, &ldquo;I employ experienced
labourers generally, but I will take you nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad answers, &ldquo;I must forewarn you, that I eat as much as
fourteen men, but I do work in proportion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asks him, &ldquo;What do you know how to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to him, &ldquo;I know a little of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day the master takes him into a field, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must mow all this meadow.&rdquo; He says to him,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The master goes away. At eight o&rsquo;clock the servant comes with
the breakfast. She had a basket full of provisions; there were six
loaves, half a ham, and six bottles of wine. Our lad was delighted. The
servant was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>astonished to see that all the meadow was mown,
and she goes and tells it to the master. He too was pleased to see that
he had such a valuable servant. He tells him to go and cut another
meadow. Before mid-day he had it all down. The servant comes with the
dinner, and was astonished to see how much work he had done. She
brought him seven loaves, seven bottles of wine, and ever so much ham,
but he cleared it all off. The master gives him again another field of
grass to cut. Before night he had done it easily. Our master was
delighted at it, and gave him plenty to eat. The servant too was highly
pleased.</p>
<p>As long as he had work the master said nothing, but afterwards, when
he saw that all the harvest served only for the servant to eat, he did
not know how to get rid of him. He sends him to a forest in which he
knew that there were terrible beasts, and told him to bring wood from
there. As soon as he has arrived a bear attacks him. He takes him by
the nostrils and throws him on the ground, and twists his neck. He
keeps pulling up all the young trees, and again a wolf attacks him; he
takes him like the bear by the nostrils, throws him down, and twists
his neck.</p>
<p>In the evening he arrives at the house, and the master is astonished
to see him return. He gave him a good supper; but he was not pleased,
because he had torn up all the young trees. At night the master turns
over in his head what he could do with his servant, and he determines
to send him into a still more terrible forest, in the hope that some
animal will devour him. Our lad goes off again. He tears up many large
trees, when a lion attacks him. He kills him in a moment. There comes
against him another terrible animal, and he finishes him off too. In
the evening, when he comes home, he said to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does my master send me into the forest? Perhaps he is
tired of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he resolves to tell him that he will leave the house. When he
arrives his master receives him well, but cannot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>understand how it is that he comes back. He
gives him a good supper, and our lad says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better for me to go off somewhere. There is no more
work for me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may reckon how pleased the master was. He gives him his wages at
once, and he goes away. He goes off, far, far, far away; but soon his
money is exhausted, and he does not know what is to become of him.</p>
<p>He sees two men standing on the bank of a river. He went up to them,
and the men ask him if he will cross them over to the other side of the
water. He answers, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and takes them both at once on
his back; and these men were our Lord and St. Peter. Our Lord says to
him in the middle of the stream:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will throw you into the water if you do not keep quiet, for
I have quite enough to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had come to the other side, the Lord said to him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must I give you as a reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you like; only give it quickly, for I am very
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives him a sack, and says to him, &ldquo;Whatever you wish for
will come into this sack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he goes off, far away. He comes to a town, and passing before a
baker&rsquo;s shop he smells an odour of very good hot loaves, and he
says to them, &ldquo;Get into my sack,&rdquo; and his sack is quite
full of them. He goes off to a corner of a forest, and there he lives
by his sack. He returns again into the town, and passes before a
pork-butcher&rsquo;s. There were there black puddings, sausages, hams,
and plenty of good things. He says, &ldquo;Come into my sack,&rdquo;
and as soon as he has said it the sack is full. He goes again to empty
it as he had done with the loaves, and he returns into the town. In
front of an inn he says, &ldquo;Come into my sack.&rdquo; There were
there bottles of good wine and of liqueurs, and to all these good
things he says, &ldquo;Come into my sack,&rdquo; and his sack was

<p>He goes off to his corner of the forest, and there he had provision
for some days; and, when he had well stuffed himself, he went out for a
walk. One day he saw some young girls weeping, and he asks them,
&ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; They answer that their
father is very ill. He asks if he can see him. They tell him,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes there then, and the poor man tells him how he has given his
soul to the devil, and that he was expecting him that very day, and he
was trembling even then. Our Fourteen asks if he will let him be on a
corner of the bed, that he might see the devil. He tells him,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He then hides himself with his sack. A moment after
the devil arrives, and our lad says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into my sack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as soon as he had said it, in goes the devil. Judge of the joy
of our man! Our lad goes off to some stone-breakers, and says to
them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit hard! the devil is in this sack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went at it, blow upon blow, stroke upon stroke, and the devil
went:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! ay! ay! let me out! let me go! ay! ay! ay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad said, &ldquo;You shall bring me, then, a paper, signed by
all the devils of hell, that you have no rights over this man.&rdquo;
The devil agrees, and he lets him go. In a moment he comes back with
the paper, and the lad makes him go into the sack again, and has him
beaten by the stone-breakers, while he carries the precious paper to
the former man; and think how happy they were in that house!</p>
<p>Our man goes off, walking, walking, on, and on, and always on, and
he grew tired of this world. He said to himself, &ldquo;I should like
to go to Heaven.&rdquo; He goes on, and on, and on, but he comes to
hell; but as soon as ever the devils saw that it was Fourteen they shut
all the gates. He goes off again, far, far, very far, and comes to
Heaven. There the gates are shut against him. What does Fourteen do? He
put his sack in through the keyhole, and says to himself: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go into the sack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he has said it he finds himself inside, and he is there
still behind the door; and when you go to Heaven, look about well, and
you will see him there.</p>

<h3 class="main">Jesus Christ and the Old Soldier.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time, when Jesus Christ was going with His
disciples to Jerusalem, He met an old man, and asked alms of him. The
old man said to Him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an old soldier, and they sent me away from the army with
only two sous, because I was no longer good for anything. I have
already given away one sou on the road; I have only one left, and I
give that to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then our Lord says to him, &ldquo;Which would you prefer, a sack of
gold or Paradise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Peter gently nudges the old man in the ribs, &ldquo;Say
Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Paradise!&rdquo; says the old soldier.
&ldquo;Afterwards we shall have Paradise as well. I prefer a sack of
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And our Lord gives him the sack of gold, and He said as He gave it
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this sack is empty it will be sufficient to say,
&lsquo;<i lang="eu">Artchila murtchila!</i> go into my sack,&rsquo; and
everything you wish for will go into the sack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our man takes the sack and goes on his road. When he had gone a
little way he passed before the door of an inn, and sees a fine leg of
mutton on the table. He was hungry, and, opening his sack, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="eu">Artchila murtchila!</i> fine leg of mutton, come
into my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>sack!&rdquo; and in an instant it was in it; and
in the same way he had everything he wished for.</p>
<p>One day the devil came to tempt this old man, but, as soon as he
heard him, he opened his sack and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="eu">Artchila murtchila!</i> go into my
sack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the devil himself entered into the sack. He takes the sack with
the devil in it to a blacksmith, and for a long time and very
vigorously he pounded it with his sledgehammer.</p>
<p>When the old soldier died he went to Paradise. When he arrived there
St. Peter appears, and says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you standing there? And what are you asking
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Paradise!! Did not you prefer to have a sack of gold
when God gave you the choice? Be off from here. Be off to hell. There
are the gates, there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our old man, in deepest sadness, goes to the door of hell, and
knocks; but as soon as the door was opened the devil recognised his
soldier, and began to cry out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him come in! Don&rsquo;t let him come in! He
will cause us too much trouble, and too many misfortunes. He is so very
vicious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he will not receive him; so he returns again to Paradise, and
God commanded St. Peter to let this man enter who had been such a foe
to the devil.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Poor Soldier and the Rich Man.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others in the world, there was a man and his
wife. They had an only son. The time for the conscription arrived. He
went away with much regret. At the end of the seven years he was
returning home with five sous in his pocket. As he was walking along a
poor man came up to him, and asked charity in the Name of God. He gave
him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>a sou, telling him that he had only five sous,
but that he could not refuse at the Name of God. A moment after another
poor man presents himself, and asks charity in the Name of God. He
gives to him, telling him repeatedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, who had only five sous to take home after seven years of
service&mdash;I have already given away one of them; but I cannot
refuse you&mdash;I shall have still enough left to get a breakfast
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he goes on, but a moment after comes another poor man, and he
gives again. This poor man says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go to such a house, and you must ask charity of M.
Tahentozen in the Name of God. He gives charity to no one; but he will
ask you in from curiosity, and to hear the news. When you have told him
all that you have seen, he will ask you where you have come from. You
must say that you come from Heaven, but that you have seen nothing
there but poor and maimed people, and that in hell there was nothing
but rich men; and that at the gate of hell there are two devils sitting
in arm-chairs, &lsquo;and I saw one arm-chair empty, and I went and
asked whom it was for; and there came two devils from the gate, limping
as if they were lame, and they said: &ldquo;This is for M. Tahentozen.
He never gives anything in charity, and, if he does not change, his
place is <i>there</i>.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our soldier goes as he has been told, and asks charity in the Name
of God. But the servant, as she always did, sent him away. The master,
having heard someone, asks the servant who is there. The servant
answers that it is a soldier who asks for charity. He tells her to
bring him up, in order to ask the news. Our soldier tells him all that
the poor man had told him to say. And there upon the rich man begins to
reflect, and he keeps the soldier at his house, and makes him rich, and
the rest (of his money) he divides among the poor.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time, and like many others in the world,
there was a widow who had a son. This son was so good to his mother
that they loved one another beyond all that can be told. One day this
son said to his mother that he must go to Rome. The mother was in the
greatest distress, but she let him go. (At parting) she gave him three
apples, and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you make acquaintance (with anyone) on the road, and if
you are thirsty, give him one of these apples to divide; and he who
will give you back the largest part, he will be a good friend to you
for the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set out then. When he has gone a little way he falls in with
three men. They made acquaintance, and they told him that they were
going to Rome. They went on, and on, and on, and as talking makes one
thirsty, the widow&rsquo;s son said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have in my pocket an apple which my mother gave me at
starting; we will eat it. Here, take and divide it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of them divides it, and gives him the smallest part. When he saw
that he made some excuse and quitted his companions. He goes travelling
on, on, on, along the road, when he meets with three monks. They tell
him that they are going to Rome, and offer to make their journey
together. When they had gone a little way, they get thirsty also. The
widow&rsquo;s son says to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an apple which my mother gave me at starting. Here it
is; take and divide it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They, too, were no better comrades than the others. They give him
only a small piece. Fortunately he remembers the advice of his mother,
and he leaves them. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>goes on a short way alone, and
sees in the distance something shining under an oak; as he approaches
he sees that it is a king. He tells him where he is going, and learns
that he too is going to Rome. The king engages him to rest himself
along with him, and he stays there a long time; and at length they get
thirsty, and the son of the widow gives him the last apple, telling him
that it is his mother who gave it him at starting. The king&rsquo;s son
divides it, and gives him the largest piece. The son of the widow is
rejoiced that he has found a good comrade, and they vow great
friendship under the oak. The son of the widow engages himself to bring
the king&rsquo;s son to Rome alive or dead, and the other binds himself
to serve and aid him as long as he has a drop of blood in his veins.
Resuming their journey they go on, and on, and on, and at length night
surprises them, and they do not know where to go to. They meet a young
girl who was going to the fountain. They ask her if shelter would be
given them in the house which they see there.</p>
<p>She answers &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; and then, lowering her voice, she
adds, &ldquo;Yes, to your misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only the widow&rsquo;s son who heard these last words. So
they go there, and enter, and are very well received. They had a good
supper given them, and a good bed on the third story. The widow&rsquo;s
son puts the prince on the outside of the bed, and he himself goes next
the wall. The former falls asleep immediately, because he was very
tired; but the widow&rsquo;s son was kept awake by his fear, and, just
as twelve o&rsquo;clock struck, he hears someone coming up stairs, and
sees the owner come into the bed-room with a large knife in his hand.
The mistress held the light and the servant a basin. They come near and
cut the throat of the king&rsquo;s son, and carry him down stairs.
While they are doing this the widow&rsquo;s son gets out on the roof,
and from there he shouts and cries out for the justice. When he had
made himself heard, he told the people what had taken place. As they
had never before heard anything like this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>of the people in the
house, they would not believe him, and put him in prison. The next day
he was condemned to death.</p>
<p>Before dying he asks one favour. It is granted him. He then asks for
two blood-hounds to go and search the house with. They grant him that,
and he goes with the servants of the justice. After having gone over
the whole castle, without having found one drop of blood, they go down
to the cellar. The dogs kept smelling about, but the master refused to
open the door, saying there was nothing there but dirt and rubbish.
They told him that he must open it all the same, and there they found
the king&rsquo;s son with his crown. This was all they wanted.</p>
<p>They set the widow&rsquo;s son at liberty; and he asks for the body
of the king&rsquo;s son, and puts it into a sack. He takes the sack on
his shoulders, and starts for Rome, where he arrives fatigued and worn
out; but he has kept his word.</p>
<p>He goes to see the Holy Father, and told him all that had taken
place, and what had happened to his friend.</p>
<p>Our Holy Father says to him, &ldquo;To-morrow, at the moment of the
Elevation, you will place the head on the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He does so, and at the very same moment the body of the king&rsquo;s
son is seized with a trembling, and he calls out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow&rsquo;s son answers, &ldquo;At Rome. Do you not remember
how your throat was cut yesterday? And I myself have carried you, as I
promised, to Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s son went to pay his visit to our Holy Father, and
(after that) they set out (home). And when they had gone a long way,
they come to the oak where they had (first) made each other&rsquo;s
acquaintance, and it is there, too, that they must part.</p>
<p>They renew their promises (to each other). The king&rsquo;s son
takes off his ring, and gives it to the other as a keep-sake to
remember him by. And the king&rsquo;s son, on counting his money,
remarks that he has just the same sum as he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>had
when he was under the oak the last time. And they quit each other, each
to go to his own home.</p>
<p>When the widow&rsquo;s son reaches home, the mother is delighted to
see her son again, and the son also (to see his mother). But the next
day he was covered with a frightful disease, which was very like
leprosy, and it had an infectious smell; but, fortunately, the mother
did not smell it. The poor mother did all that she could to cure her
son, but nothing relieved him. She heard that there was a monk in the
neighbourhood, a great saint, who cured diseases. She sends for him,
and the widow&rsquo;s son relates to him his journey to Rome, and all
that had taken place there, and he tells also the promises which they
had made to each other.</p>
<p>Then the monk says to him, &ldquo;If you wish to be cured, there is
only one remedy&mdash;you must wash yourself in the blood of this
king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This news made the young man very sad, but his mother would start
the very next day; and they set out on their journey in an old
carriage. Everyone where they passed stopped their noses, and said,
&ldquo;Pheu! pheu!&rdquo; After some time they came to the king&rsquo;s
house. The mother asks leave to speak to the king, but a servant drives
her far away, because of the smell, telling her not to approach nearer.
So she could not say anything to the king. But one day the king goes
out, and sees the carriage, and he asks what it is. They tell him that
it is a sick man, who smells like putrid fish, and who wishes to see
the king. The king is angry because they had not told him of it
before.</p>
<p>Now this king was married, and already he had a son. He orders the
people in the carriage to come to him, and the widow&rsquo;s son told
him who he was, and showed him the ring which he had formerly given
him. Without paying the least attention to his malady, the king takes
him in his arms and embraces him. The widow&rsquo;s son tells him the
grief that he had felt at what the monk had told him.</p>
<p>The king goes to find his wife, and tells her what has happened
about the sick man at the gate, and how this sick <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>man
had already restored him to life, and that now it was his turn, and
that he could not be cured except by washing in his blood; and (he bids
her) choose between her child and himself. This poor mother sacrifices
her son. They kill him. The sick man washes himself immediately (in the
blood), and is cured at the same instant. The queen, in her grief, goes
into her child&rsquo;s bedroom, and there she finds her son full of
life again. Overflowing with joy, she takes up her son, and goes out
crying to everyone, and showing them her infant. Judge what a delight
for them all! The widowed mother and her son lived in the king&rsquo;s
palace so happily, and never left him more.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Story of the Hair-Cloth Shirt (La Cilice).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time, like many others in the world, there
was a gentleman and a lady. They had no children, but they longed for
one above everything. They made a vow to go to Rome. As soon as they
had made the vow, the woman became pregnant.</p>
<p>The husband said to her, &ldquo;We shall do well to go there at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife said, &ldquo;We have not time enough now; we can go
afterwards just as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady was confined of a boy. The boy grows up and he sees that
his father is constantly sad, and he finds him often crying in all the
corners. The little boy was now seven years old, and the mother had not
yet decided to go to Rome. One day this young boy goes into his
father&rsquo;s bed-room, and finds him weeping again. He therefore said
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he will not answer him, and the child takes a pistol, and says
to his father: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will not tell me what is the matter with you, I will
shoot first you and myself afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father then said that he would tell him, (and he told him) how
that his mother and he had made a vow to go to Rome if they had a
child, and that they had never been there.</p>
<p>The child said to him, &ldquo;It is for me that this vow was made,
and it is I who will go and fulfil it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; and sets out.</p>
<p>He was seven years on the road, and begged his bread. At last he
comes to the Holy Father, and tells him what has brought him there. Our
Holy Father puts him in a room alone for an hour.</p>
<p>When he comes out, he says to him, &ldquo;Oh, you have made a
mistake; you have made me stay there two hours at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our Holy Father tells him &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&mdash;that he has been
there only one hour. And he puts him into another room for two
hours.</p>
<p>When he came out from there he said, &ldquo;You have made me stop
more than two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to him, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and puts him in another room for
three hours.</p>
<p>When he came out of that he said, &ldquo;You have only left me there
three minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he said to him, &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes; you have been there three
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And our Holy Father told him that the first room was Hell; that the
second was Purgatory; and that the last was Heaven.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6313src" href="#xd26e6313" name="xd26e6313src">3</a></p>
<p>The child says to him, &ldquo;Where am I? I in Paradise! And my
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Paradise too.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208"
href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was grieved, and said to him, &ldquo;Can I not save my
mother? I would let my blood flow for her for seven years
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our Holy Father tells him that he can, and he puts on him a
hair-cloth shirt with a padlock, and throws the key into the water.</p>
<p>And our Holy Father says to him, &ldquo;When you shall find this
key, your mother will be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He starts off, begging his way as before, and takes seven more years
before arriving in his own country. He goes from house to house asking
alms. His father meets him and asks him where he comes from. He says,
&ldquo;From Rome.&rdquo; He asks him if he has not seen on the road a
boy of his own age. He says to him, &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; and tells
him that he has gone on walking for seven years, shedding his blood to
save his mother. And he keeps on talking about his son. His mother
comes out on the staircase and tells her husband to send that poor man
away&mdash;that he must be off from there. But he pays no attention to
her. He brings him in, and tells her that he is going to dine with
them. His wife is not pleased. He sends the servant to market, telling
her to buy the finest fish that she can find. When the young girl comes
back, she goes to the poultry yard to clean the fish. The young man
follows her, and as she was cleaning the fish she found a key inside
it.</p>
<p>The young man said to her, &ldquo;That key belongs to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she gives it to him.</p>
<p>The lady could not endure this young man, and she gives him a push,
and he falls into the well. All on a sudden the water of the well
overflows, and the young man comes out all dripping. The husband had
not seen that his wife had pushed him into the well, and the young man
told him that he had fallen into it. This poor man wishes to give him
some clothes, but he will not accept them, saying that he will dry
himself at the fire. At table the lady is not at all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>polite to him. The young man asks her if she
would recognise her son.</p>
<p>She says, &ldquo;Yes, yes; he has a mark between his two
breasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the young man opens his clothes, and shows the mark. At the same
time he gives the key to his mother that she may open his hair-cloth
shirt, and the mother sees nothing but blood and gore. He has suffered
for her. The three die. And the servant sees three white doves fly
away. I wish I could do like them in the same way.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Saintly Orphan Girl.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a young girl who lived far from the world,
alone, in sanctity. Every day a dove brought her her food.</p>
<p>One day she saw a young girl whom two gens-d&rsquo;armes were taking
to prison or to execution. The orphan said to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she had lived like me, they would not have taken her to
prison.&rdquo; And thereupon she had a thought of pride, and from that
day the dove no longer brought her anything to eat. She goes to seek a
priest, and tells him what has happened, and since when she does not
receive any more food. This priest tells her that she has been punished
on account of that thought, and that she must be present at the birth
of three children, and see what their gifts would be. The first was the
son of a king. She asks the queen permission to remain in the
bed-chamber, no matter in what corner; all would be the same to her if
she would only give her leave. She consents to it. When this queen
gives birth to a boy, the infant has round its neck a white cord,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>and this orphan understood that he would be
guillotined<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6363src" href="#xd26e6363" name=
"xd26e6363src">4</a> when he was eighteen years old. She sees the birth
of another child; a girl with a red cord round her neck, and she sees
that she will turn out badly, and that she would go to ruin. She sees a
third; this was a boy, and he had blue cord on, which meant that he
would be very good.</p>
<p>After having seen that this orphan goes back to the house of the
queen. There she lived happily, busying herself especially about this
child. As she caressed it she often used to say in a sad tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother remarked that, and one day she said: &ldquo;One would say
that this child was very unfortunate. Do you always act thus when you
caress a child, as if it were very wretched, or as if something were
going to happen to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said that to her more than once. And when the (fated) age was
drawing near, this orphan told the queen what must happen at the age of
eighteen. I leave you to judge of the distress of this queen. She told
it to her husband, and the father and mother told it to their son; and
he said that he must leave the house immediately. He goes then a long
way off to another town. And as he was a pretty good scholar, he got a
place in a house where there was a large shop. They sold everything
there; and as this lad was very good everybody loved him. They heard
him go out of the house every night, but they did not know where. The
master was curious (to learn this), and he made a hole above the shop,
for he went there too in the night. He sees him take a wax candle, and
put the price of this candle into the cash-box by the hole, counting
the money aloud. Taking the candle with him he falls on his knees, and
went a considerable distance to a chapel, walking still on his knees.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>The master follows him during a whole week, and
the boy did always the same thing; and on the eighth day the master
looks through the key-hole of the chapel, and sees an angel descend and
throw a chain to our lad, and the angel lifted him up in the air. A
moment after he comes down again, and goes back to his master&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>The master tells him that he has seen all, and the boy says that his
penance is also finished, and that he must go home. The master does not
wish it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall go afterwards, if you wish it; but first you must
marry my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells him that he has a father and mother, and that he cannot do
it without telling them; but if they wish it, he will do so
willingly.</p>
<p>He starts home then at once. You may imagine what joy for the king
and the queen. They were constantly trembling lest they should hear
that their dearly loved son had been hanged. They did not know what to
do for joy. He told them how he had done penance, and that without
doubt the good God had pardoned him; and how his old master wished him
to marry his daughter. He does so, and all live happily and die
well.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Slandered and Despised Young Girl.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like many others of us in the world, there was a
mother and her daughter. They were very poor, and the daughter said
that she wished to go out to service, in order to do something for her
mother. The mother will not listen to it; what would become of her
without her daughter? She prefers to be poor with her to being rich
alone. The young girl stays at home. She used to go out as needlewoman;
but suddenly her mother falls ill, and quickly she dies.</p>
<p>This poor young girl had the deepest sorrow, and she continued to go
out to work as before. One day, while she was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>at
work in a house, some acquaintance came and said to them&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you have this young girl here to work! She is a bad
girl; she is not at all what she ought to be. You should not take
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening they give her her day&rsquo;s wages, and say that
they do not want her any more. She goes to another house, and there the
same thing happens. Some people come and say in the same way&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have that young girl to work! She will come to a bad end,
that girl will. She is even a thief; do not have her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening they give her her day&rsquo;s wages, and say to her
that they do not want her any more. No one asked her to work any more,
and she remained at home. By charity and pity, some neighbours, without
any necessity, let her come to work for them, because they were pained
to see her distress. But there, too, someone comes and says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am astonished to see that young girl here. She is a
worthless girl. How is it that you have her here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They answer, &ldquo;Moved by charity, just to help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not have her any more; she is a thief, and as bad as can
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having given her her day&rsquo;s wages, they send her off, and
say that they do not want her any more.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6414src" href="#xd26e6414" name="xd26e6414src">5</a></p>
<p>This poor young girl was in the greatest distress; if she wished to
eat, she must beg. She set to work begging then, and everyone disliked
her so much that, when they saw her, they used to spit at her.</p>
<p>There came home from one of his voyages a ship&rsquo;s captain, and,
while he was amusing himself with his friends, this young girl asks for
charity. His friends tell <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=
"#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>him that she was a bad girl, and
they spit at her, and he does like the rest. Our captain goes off for
another voyage; but he was overtaken by a terrible tempest. The storm
was so violent, and the rain came down as if it would never leave off;
it made them all tremble. In the midst of his prayers the captain made
a vow that, if he escaped, he would marry the worst and most despised
girl that he could find. Immediately the weather became fine. He makes
a very successful voyage, and one which brought him plenty of money;
but, when he reached land, he forgot his vow, and began to amuse
himself as much as possible.</p>
<p>This same young girl asks charity, and, after his friends have told
him that she was a bad girl, they spat at her, and he did so too.</p>
<p>Again he goes to sea, and he is overtaken by a storm, much worse
than the former one. The wind was most violent, and the lightning
terrible; they saw nothing but that. All trembled, and were praying.
The captain again makes a vow of marrying, if he should get safe home,
with the most abandoned and the poorest girl he can find, and he
regrets that he has not kept his vow. He said to himself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had kept it, perhaps I should not have had such weather
as this; but nothing now shall make me forget my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately the weather becomes fine; he has immense good fortune,
and gains as much money as he wishes.</p>
<p>When he comes home, he sees this young girl again. His friends spit
at her, but he says to them,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not spit at her&mdash;I wish to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His friends burst out into roars of laughter, &ldquo;Ha! ha!
ha!&rdquo; The sailor goes home to his mother, and tells her that he is
going to be married. His mother answers him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you make a good and rich marriage, very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son said to her, &ldquo;She is not at all rich. She is that girl
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother was not pleased. &ldquo;Leave that bad girl alone.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;It is all the same to me; I will marry none but
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asks his friends where she lives. They point to an old house. The
captain goes there in the evening and knocks at the door. The girl
says, &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man says, &ldquo;Open the door for me. It is I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl says, &ldquo;I will not open the door&mdash;I am in
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I will not do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to break in the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what you will, but I will not open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He breaks open the door, as he said, and goes in. He sees this young
girl on a little straw, covered only by her dress. The man wants to go
near her. The girl says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may kill me if you like, but you shall not come near
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were like that a long time. The man says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your promise of marriage, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl says, &ldquo;What do you mean? I so poor and you so
rich&mdash;how can we marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man says that they will do so. The young girl will not believe
him, and the gentleman says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give me your promise I will go away at
once.&rdquo; And the young girl says &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; in order to
make him go away. Then he goes away.</p>
<p>The next day he goes to a priest and tells him what has taken place,
and gives him forty thousand francs, and tells him to build a fine
house with it, and to furnish it, and if anything more is wanting he
will pay it at his next voyage. The young girl, too, goes to the
priest, for before this she had been helped and comforted by him. The
priest tells her how the captain had given him forty thousand francs
for her to build a fine house with, and for her to make use of for all
she wanted. The priest said that he would undertake building the house,
and she said that she would see to all that was wanting for herself.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>The captain goes off, and has as successful a voyage as could be
made&mdash;he had nothing but fair weather. He brought back plenty of
money, and they were married soon after his arrival. His mother and his
brothers and sister were at the wedding. After some time the captain
wished to go and make another voyage. He left his fine house to take
his wife to his mother&rsquo;s house, and he said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife will be better with you than all alone. You will have
her always dressed as becomes her position, and keep a good table for
her, and take good care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband went to sea. He often wrote to his wife; but what do the
captain&rsquo;s mother and her daughter do after he is gone? They take
away from this lady all her pretty dresses, and make her put on old
ones, and wooden shoes too with straw inside, and send her off to keep
the geese with a bit of bread, telling her that she must bring home a
load of small wood (to light the fire with), and that she must keep
spinning while she is watching the geese. This poor young girl says
nothing. She goes off with her flock of geese. When night comes she
returns with four skeins of thread spun and a load of small wood. Every
day she does the same. They do not even tell her that her husband has
written to her.</p>
<p>The captain has a fine voyage. He had some fears about his mother
and his sister, and he thought to himself that it would be best to come
home secretly, in silence, and see how they were treating his wife. He
comes then as a foreigner, in the dress of a captain. He says that he
comes from a distance, and that he wishes to pass a week in their
house. The mother and the daughter receive him very well. They tell him
to choose his own room, and he chooses his own wedding-chamber. At
nightfall the geese come home, cackling, cackling, and with them the
young girl. This gentleman tells them that it is his habit to have some
young girl with him when he travels like that, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>asks
them if they can get him one. They tell him &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; that
there would be none more glad than this young girl, and that they will
give her to him. They go and tell it to the goose girl.</p>
<p>She says that certainly she will not go. They say to her that he has
chests full of gold, and that they would willingly go, but that he has
chosen her; and they push her by force into the room. The gentleman
orders an excellent supper, and says that he has the habit of supping
well. The goose girl stands sadly before the table. She would not eat
anything; the gentleman presses her, and she kept saying that she was
not hungry&mdash;that she had eaten as much as she usually did. He asks
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you eaten? and what have you eaten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A piece of bread that I took with me in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells her again to eat these good things. She says that she does
not want anything, and that the greatest pleasure he can give her is to
let her go off to her geese. The gentleman says to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know then why you have come here? You are to sleep
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl says: &ldquo;You shall cut me in pieces on the spot
before I will go to your bed. I have a husband, and I wish to be
faithful to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she tells, on his asking her, how that she was very poor, and no
one loved her, and how a rich gentleman had wished to marry
her&mdash;how very good he had been to her even after the marriage, and
how when he went on a voyage he had left her at his mother&rsquo;s
house, thinking that she would be best there, and that since he was
gone she had had no news of her husband. The gentleman said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you recognise your husband?&rdquo; She says,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he any marks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl says, &ldquo;Yes; he has a mole between his two
breasts with three hairs on it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p>The gentleman opens his shirt and shows her his birthmark.</p>
<p>This young girl was seized with such joy that she fainted away, and
fell down on the floor. As this gentleman knew the ways of the room he
burst open the closet, and took a bottle of liqueur to bring his wife
round again, and at last she came to herself, and passes a sweet night
with her husband.</p>
<p>The next morning the geese come, cackle, cackle, before the door,
and the mistress of the house and her daughter come to the
gentleman&rsquo;s door, calling out, if they have not stopped there
long enough, that it is time to set off, and that it is a shame to be
in bed at that hour. The gentleman gets up and says to his mother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, mother, was this the way that you ought to have treated
my dearly-loved wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was in such a rage that, if his wife had not begged him to
forgive her, he would even have beaten her; but his wife prevented him.
He sent his mother and his sister out of the house, and he and his wife
lived for many years happy and pleased with each other; and as they
lived well they died well too.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">The Sister of Laurentine.</span></p>
<p>This may be Toutou, but in the Basque country it is sometimes
difficult to get hold of a person&rsquo;s surname. &ldquo;Who is
Laurentine?&rdquo; you ask. &ldquo;She is Toutou&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo;
is the reply. &ldquo;But who is Toutou?&rdquo; &ldquo;She is
Laurentine&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo; If you want to get anything more out
you have to cross-examine for half-an-hour. Some of our tales are not
signed; we believe these are to be divided between Catherine Elizondo
and Laurentine Kopena. Fresh names we think we always put down, but
these brought so many tales that we sometimes omitted it with them, and
in the rearrangement for printing we have lost our clue. <span class=

<p>We have some thirteen other tales of all kinds, besides variations,
which we have not given. They are mostly short, and not very different
in character from those given above, except in being more stupid in two
or three cases; and a few of them are to be found in M.
Cerquand&rsquo;s collection.</p>

of the old gods into the service of Christ, and including the most
human of them in His salvation. The last part of the tale is very
widely spread. It is given by F. Caballero in the Spanish, and by

"An Essay on the Basque Language," width="720" height="152"></div>
<h2 class="main">An Essay on the Basque Language,</h2>
<p class="byline">By M. Julien Vinson.</p>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Basque Language is one which is particularly
attractive to specialists. Its place in the general series of idioms
has at last been well defined&mdash;it is an agglutinative and
incorporating language, with some tendency to polysynthetism. It
consequently finds a place in the second great morphological linguistic
group, between the Finnic and the North American family of languages. I
shall now attempt a very short sketch of its general features; but I
must ask permission, first, briefly to state some of the most essential
principles of the science of language.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the science of language&mdash;that is to
say, the science of the characteristic phenomenon of the human species,
is a purely natural science. It has nothing in common with philology,
which is mainly a historical study. Whether it be called
<i>linguistique</i>, glottology, phonology, or even, by a too common
abuse, comparative philology, the science of language follows the same
method as the other natural sciences, and advances by observation and
experience. The direct subject-matter of this science is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>those vocal organisms which express, by sensible
sounds, thought and its divers modes of existence. These organisms are
the spontaneous and unconscious product of organs which, as natural
phenomena, fall under the general law of perpetual variation, acted on
by their surroundings, climate, &amp;c.; but as incapable of being
modified by the external or internal exercise of human volition as any
other of the organized beings which surround us.</p>
<p>But as the object of language is to express thought in all its
niceties, both the fact that gives rise to it, and the modifications of
it caused by time and space, so it is seen that different idioms have
adopted different methods of expressing, in the best and readiest
manner, the idea, the conception or intuition, with its variable forms,
in order to translate with precision its <i>signification</i>, and its
relations. From this point of view language has been divided into three
great groups: the first, that of isolating languages, wherein the
monosyllabic roots all retain their meaning, and wherein the relations
are only expressed conventionally, <i>i.e.</i>, were not originally
expressed at all; the second, that of agglutinative languages, in which
the relations are expressed by roots once significative, but now
reduced to a secondary and subordinate office; lastly, the third, that
of inflectional languages, in which the change of relations is
expressed by a modification in the root itself, and even in the radical
vowel. It is clear that the idioms of the second group were once
isolating, and that inflectional idioms have passed through both the
former states. We conclude from this that language is essentially
progressive and variable in the sense of a constant improvement in the
expression of relations. And yet, in the study of existing languages we
find, on the contrary, that they are often in this respect inferior to
their ancestors.</p>
<p>This contradiction, however, is only an apparent one. Thus, as
Schleicher has demonstrated, languages are born, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>grow
up, become stationary, decline and die; in a word, live after the same
fashion as do organized beings. There are in every language two
principal periods&mdash;that of <i>formal development</i>, during which
the idiom passes from the first (monosyllabic) stage to the second
(agglutinative) by reducing certain roots to a secondary and dependent
office, then from the second to the third (inflectional) by a new
effort to express simultaneously signification and relation; and that
of <i>formal decay</i>, during which the original meaning of the
relative affixes is more and more forgotten, they get worn out, change
by degrees, and often end by perishing altogether. <i>Formal decay</i>
begins when a language becomes historical, and it often gives rise to
remarkable cases of <i>regressive metamorphosis</i>. One remark which
we must make on this subject is that the known agglutinative languages
have not spontaneously arrived at historical life&mdash;that is to say,
have not commenced their decay, except under the influence of a foreign
idiom either isolating or inflectional. Nevertheless, during their
decay, languages can adopt fresh forms, but these are merely composed
of words already in use; man in the historical period has no longer
bare roots at his service.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6578src" href=
"#xd26e6578" name="xd26e6578src">1</a></p>
<p>These linguistic elements are, moreover, subject to the terrible law
of the struggle for existence, and of vital competition. Many of them
have perished and have left no trace; others are preserved to us merely
in some scanty records. The Basque, pressed hard by Latin and its
derived languages, has lost ground, especially in Spain. Beyond its
actual limits, there are in Navarre many villages, the names of which
are Basque, but in which Spanish only is spoken; and all along the
frontiers of the actual region of the Basque <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>in
the Spanish provinces this idiom is spoken only by a minority of the
inhabitants. It is, moreover, undergoing modification everywhere; the
children often replace the old expressive native terms by a vocabulary
drawn from the Romance tongues. In those places which are most in
contact with strangers, and in which the movement of modern life is
most keenly felt&mdash;at St. Sebastian and at St. Jean de Luz, for
instance&mdash;the language has become exceedingly debased and
incorrect. Everything presages the speedy extinction of the Escuara or
Euscara, which is the name given to the Basque by those who speak it.
The word, apparently, means merely &ldquo;manner of speaking.&rdquo;
All people have, in a greater or less degree, the pretension which
caused the Greeks to treat all foreigners as barbarians&mdash;that is,
as not properly-speaking men.</p>
<p>Prince L. L. Bonaparte reckons the actual number of the Basques, not
including emigrants established in Mexico, at Monte Video, and at
Buenos Ayres, at 800,000, of whom 660,000 are in Spain, and 140,000 in
France.</p>
<p>The phonetic laws of the Escuara are simple; the sounds most
frequently employed are the sibilants, nasals, and hard gutturals; the
soft consonants are often suppressed between two vowels. The mixed
sounds, between palatals and gutturals, characteristic of the second
large group of languages, are also frequently met with. One of the
predominant features is the complete absence of reduplication of
consonants, the aversion to groups of consonants, and the care taken to
complete the sound of final mute consonants by an epenthetic vowel. It
is probable that originally the words were composed of a series of
syllables formed regularly of a single consonant and a vowel. We must
mention, besides, the double form of the nominatives, one of which is
used only as the subject of an active verb; the other serves equally
for the subject of the intransitive, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>and the object of the
active verb. This is absolutely the same distinction remarked by M.
Fried. M&uuml;ller in the Australian languages between the subjective
and the predicative nominative.</p>
<p>Formal derivation is accomplished by means of suffixing the elements
of relations; pronominal signs are nevertheless not only suffixed, but
also prefixed to verbs. Except in this respect, nouns and verbs are not
treated in two distinct manners; they are both equally susceptible of
receiving suffixes which mark the relations of time and space, and many
of which have preserved in their integrity both their proper
signification and their primitive sonorous form. The article is the
remote demonstrative pronoun. The pronouns &ldquo;we&rdquo; and
&ldquo;ye&rdquo; are not the plurals of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and
&ldquo;thou,&rdquo; but have the appearance of special individualities.
There are no possessive derivative terms; &ldquo;my house,&rdquo; for
example, is expressed by &ldquo;the house of me,&rdquo; and has no
analogy with &ldquo;I eat,&rdquo; or any other verbal expression. There
are no genders, although some suffixes are specially replaced by others
in the names of animate beings; and in the verb there are special forms
to indicate if a man or woman is being spoken to. There is no dual. The
sign of the plural is interposed between the article and the suffixes.
In the singular alone can there be an indefinite or indeterminate
declension without the article.</p>
<p>The conjugation is exceedingly complicated. The Basque verb includes
in a single verbal expression the relations of space; of one person to
another&mdash;(1) <i>subjective</i> (the idea of neutrality, of action
limited to its author), (2) <i>objective</i> (the idea of action on a
direct object), and (3) <i>attributive</i> (the idea of an action done
to bear on an object viewed indirectly, the idea of indirect action);
the relations of time; the relations of state, corresponding to as many
distinct moods; the variations of action, expressed by different
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>voices; the distinctions of subject or object,
marked by numerous personal forms; the conditions of time and state
which are expressed by conjunctions in modern languages&mdash;to each
of these relations is appropriated an affix, often considerably
abbreviated and condensed, but almost always recognisable.</p>
<p>The primitive Basque verb&mdash;that is to say, in its full
development&mdash;did not differ from that of other languages of the
globe. It comprised only two <i>moods</i>, the indicative, and the
conjunctive, which was derived from the indicative by a suffix; and
three <i>tenses</i>, the present, the imperfect, and a kind of aorist
indicating eventual possibility. There was only one <i>secondary
voice</i>, the causative, formed by a special affix. To these forms it
joined the signs of the direct and indirect object, which is the
essential characteristic of incorporating idioms.</p>
<p>During its historic life, during its period of formal decay, the
verb has experienced in Basque modifications which are not found to a
similar extent elsewhere. The primitive conjugation, or, so to say, the
simple and direct one of verbal nouns, has little by little fallen into
disuse, and has been replaced by a singular combination of verbal
nouns, of adjectives, and of some auxiliary verbs. Thus it is that the
Escuara, in all its dialects, has developed eleven moods and ninety-one
tenses (each of which has three persons in each number), variable
according to the sex or rank of the person addressed; it receives
besides a certain number of terminations, which perform the office of
our conjunctions. Moreover, from the totality of these auxiliaries two
parallel series have been formed, which, joined alternatively to nouns
of action, produce the active and middle voices, or rather the
transitive and intransitive. The auxiliaries of the periphrastic
conjugation are almost the only verbs that have been preserved
belonging to the simple primitive system. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span></p>
<p>With regard to syntax, the Basque resembles all agglutinative
languages. The sentence is always simple. The phrases are generally
short; relative pronouns are unknown. The complexity of the verb, which
unites many ideas in a single word, contributes to this simplicity of
the sentence, in which the subject and the attribute, with their
respective complements, tend to form but one expression. This object is
attained by the invariability of the adjectives, and especially by
composition.</p>
<p>The adjective is placed after the noun it qualifies, whilst the
genitive, on the contrary, precedes the governing noun.</p>
<p>Composition is of such common use in Basque, that it has caused
several juxta-posed words to be contracted and reduced, so as to be
partially confounded one with the other. This phenomenon is familiar to
languages of the New World; it is this which properly constitutes
<i>polysynthetism</i>, and which we must carefully distinguish from
<i>incorporation</i>. This last word should be reserved to designate
more particularly the phenomena of objective or attributive conjugation
common to idioms of the second form.</p>
<p>The Basque vocabulary appears to be very poor. Although it is still
imperfectly known (for the old books, and the names of places, as well
as certain little studied dialectic variations, must have retained some
words generally forgotten), we are yet able to assert that pure Basque
terms do not express abstract ideas. Except in words borrowed from the
Gascon, French, Spanish, and Latin, we find no trace of any advanced
civilization, and we can discover but very few expressions which imply
collectivity or generalization&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, there is no word
which has the wide signification of our word &ldquo;tree,&rdquo; of our
&ldquo;animal.&rdquo; &ldquo;God&rdquo; is simply, by anthropomorphism,
&ldquo;the Master on High.&rdquo; One and the same word translates our
ideas of &ldquo;will, desire, fancy, thought.&rdquo; Borrowed words
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>are more numerous, from the fact that the
influence of Aryan dialects has been felt through many ages; it is
probably owing to their contact with the Indo-European races that the
Basques, or those who used to speak the Basque, have any historical
existence.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to study this singular idiom, it is necessary to
understand thoroughly the history of the intervention of Latin in the
Pyrenean region. No assistance is to be obtained from written
documents, for there is not (and there cannot have been) any primitive
Basque literature. The oldest book was published in 1545.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6642src" href="#xd26e6642" name="xd26e6642src">2</a>
The second is the Protestant version of the New Testament, printed at
La Rochelle by order of Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, in 1571.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6645src" href="#xd26e6645" name=
"xd26e6645src">3</a></p>
<p>Another difficulty arises from the extreme variability of the
language. There are, perhaps, not two villages where it is spoken
absolutely in the same manner. This is natural enough among an
unlettered people, and one which can only rise to the level of the
surrounding civilization by forgetting its ancient language. These
different varieties are easily grouped into secondary dialects. Prince
L. L. Bonaparte recognises twenty-five of them, but they are reduced
without difficulty to eight great dialects. A closer inspection further
reduces these eight divisions to three; that is to say, the differences
between the eight principal dialects are unequal, and admit of partial
resemblances.</p>
<p>The eight dialects are: (1) The Labourdine, (2) The Souletine, (3)
The Eastern Lower-Navarrese, (4) The Western Lower-Navarrese, (5) The
Northern Upper-Navarrese, (6) The Southern Upper-Navarrese, (7) The
Guipuzcoan, (8) The Biscayan. The Souletine and the two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>Lower-Navarrese dialects form the first group,
which may be called the Oriental division. The Biscayan alone forms the
Western, and the four others form the Central group. These names are
taken from territorial divisions. <i>La Soule</i> was formerly a
province feudatory to Navarre, and now embraces, within the French
department of the Basses-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, the cantons of
Maul&eacute;on and Tardets, as well as some parishes of the canton of
St. Palais, in the arrondissement of Maul&eacute;on. The
<i>Labourd</i>, a viscounty, vassal of the Duchy of Aquitaine,
corresponded to the cantons of Bayonne (excepting the city itself and
three other parishes), of St. Jean de Luz, of Ustaritz, of Espelette,
and part of Hasparren, in the arrondissement of Bayonne. The remaining
part of the two French arrondissements which we have just named
composes Lower Navarre, which is again subdivided into the districts of
Cize, Mixe, Arberoue, Ostabaret, and the valleys of Osses and Baigorry.
This was originally the sixth merindad of Navarre, a kingdom which
extended into Spain as far as the Ebro, from Garde and Cort&eacute;s on
the one side to Vera and Viana on the other. Basque is still spoken
along the French frontier and in several valleys forming the upper part
of the territory. <i>Guipuzcoa</i> contains the cantons
(<i>partidos</i>) of St. Sebastian, Tolosa, Azpeitia, and Vergara.
Biscay comprises all the territory between Ondarroa and the river of
Sommorostro, between La Carranza and the Pe&ntilde;a de Gorbea.</p>
<p>The dialects do not correspond exactly to the territorial
subdivisions whose names they bear. Thus the Western Lower-Navarrese is
spoken in a part of the ancient Labourd; the Biscayan in Guipuzcoa.
Lastly, on the Spanish maps, there is another Basque province, Alava;
but Basque is scarcely spoken there, excepting in a narrow strip along
the northern frontier. The dialect of these Alavese districts is
included in the Biscayan. To resume, the Biscayan dialect <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>is
now spoken in Alava, Biscay, and the western third part of Guipuzcoa,
in Vergara, and in Las Salinas; the Guipuzcoan in almost all the rest
of Guipuzcoa; the Northern Upper-Navarrese in some villages of
Guipuzcoa on the French frontier, in Fontarabie, Irun, and in the
northern part of Navarre; the Southern Upper-Navarrese in the rest of
Basque Navarre; the Labourdine in the south-western part of the
arrondissement of Bayonne; the Western Lower-Navarrese in the
north-eastern part of the same arrondissement; the Souletine is spoken
in the two cantons of Maul&eacute;on and Tardets, and at Esquiule in
the arrondissement of Oloron; the Eastern Lower-Navarrese extends into
the arrondissement of Bayonne as far as St. Pierre d&rsquo;Irube, by
Meharrin, Ayherre, Briscous, Urcuit.</p>
<p>Of these arrondissements, of these provinces, none is entirely
Basque in a linguistic point of view, except Guipuzcoa. Navarre is only
half so, Alava only a tenth part. A little less than a fourth part has
to be subtracted from Biscay, and certain Gascon villages from the
arrondissements of Maul&eacute;on and Bayonne in France. Neither
Bayonne, nor Pampeluna, nor Bilbao are Basque.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6672src" href="#xd26e6672" name="xd26e6672src">4</a> And,
moreover, skirting the districts where the Basque is the native idiom
of the majority of the inhabitants, on many points there is an
intermediate zone in which Basque is known only by a minority of the
population; nevertheless, this zone must be included in the
geographical area of the idiom, since the persons who speak Basque in
it know it as their native language, and have never learnt it. This
zone is most extensive in Navarre, but exists also in Alava and in
Biscay. In France there is no analogous mixed zone; and, as M. P.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>Broca remarks (&ldquo;Sur l&rsquo;Origine et la
Repartition de la Langue Basque,&rdquo; Paris, 1875, p. 39), &ldquo;the
demarcation is brusque, and may be indicated by a single line.&rdquo;
The Basques, moreover, in this respect, present some curious points for
study. &ldquo;In the valley of Roncal the men speak Spanish together;
with the women they speak Basque, as do the women to each other. A
similar state of things is to be observed at Ochagavia in Salazar. But
this custom is not observed in the Roncalese villages of Uztarroz and
Isaba, where the men among themselves speak indifferently Basque or
Spanish.&rdquo; (Prince L. L. Bonaparte, &ldquo;Etudes sur les Dialects
d&rsquo;Aezcoa,&rdquo; &amp;c., p. 3).</p>
<p>The preceding description justifies the opinion advanced at the
beginning of this notice. The Basque is an agglutinative idiom, and
must be placed, in a morphological point of view, between the Finnic
family, which is simply incorporating, and the North American
incorporating and polysynthetic families. But we must not conclude
thence that the Escuara is a near relation either of the Finnic or of
the Magyar, of the Algonquin or of the Irokese. The relationship of two
or more languages cannot, in fact, be concluded merely from a
resemblance of their external physiognomy. To prove a community of
origin, it is indispensable that (if compared at the same stage of
development) their principal grammatical elements should not only be
analogous in their functions, but should also have a certain phonetic
resemblance, in order to render the hypothesis of their original
identity admissible. It is better to abstain from asserting that such
languages are derived from the same source, if the significant
roots&mdash;which, after all, constitute the proper basis, the true
originality of a language&mdash;should be found to be totally
different. At present, no language has been discovered which presents
any root-likeness to the Basque, analogous to that which exists
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>between the Sanscrit, Greek, and Gothic, or
between Arabic and Hebrew.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are in the world minds so devoted to the worship
of their own fixed ideas, so smitten with their own metaphysical
dreams, so full of faith in the necessity of the unity of language,
that they have acquired the habit of torturing the radical elements of
a language, and of making them flexible and variable to an
inconceivable degree. They pass their lives in seeking etymologies,
such as those which Schleicher calls &ldquo;<i lang=
"de">Etymologizerungen ins blanc hinein</i>,&rdquo; and in discovering
phonetic miracles&mdash;worthy children of those students of the last
centuries who, in the general ignorance of the science of language,
traced up all languages to Hebrew. The adventurous spirits to whom I
allude have invented a theory of languages in which the vocabulary is
incessantly renewed, and have formed the great &ldquo;Turanian&rdquo;
family, in which everything which is neither Aryan, nor Semitic, nor
Chinese, must be perforce included. In this <i lang="es">olla
podrida</i>, where the Japanese elbows the Esquimaux, and the
Australian shakes hands with the Turkish, where the Tamul fraternizes
with the Hungarian, a place is carefully reserved for the Basque. Many
amateurs, more daring still, have wedded the Escuara, or at least those
who speak it, to the <i lang="es">soi-disant</i> Khamitic tribes of
Egypt; others have united them to the ancient Ph&oelig;nicians; others
have seen in them the descendants of the Alans; others again, thanks to
the Atlantides, make them a colony of Americans. It is not long since
it was seriously affirmed, and in perfect good faith, that the Basques
and the Kelts, the Welsh or Bretons, understood each other, and could
converse at length, each using his native tongue. I refer these last to
the poet Rulhi&egrave;re:</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;La contrari&eacute;t&eacute; tient souvent au
langage:</p>
<p class="line">On peut s&rsquo;entendre moins parlant un m&ecirc;me
son,</p>
<p class="line">Que si l&rsquo;un parlait Basque et l&rsquo;autre
Bas-Breton.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>The more serious of these foes of negative conclusions, of these
refiners of quintessences, assert that the ancestors of the Basques are
incontestably the Iberians. In the first place I will remark that,
supposing this proved, the Basques, or, if you will, the Iberians,
would not be the less isolated; for how could the Iberian, any more
than the Basque, be allied to the Keltic or to the Carthaginian? But
this Iberian theory is not yet at all proved, and it will be easy to
show it to be so in a few words. It reposes first of all on the
following <i>&agrave; priori</i>&mdash;the Iberians have occupied all
Spain and the south of Gaul, but the Escuara lives still at the foot of
the Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es; therefore the Escuara is a remnant of the
language of the Iberians. The error of the syllogism is patent; the
conclusion does not follow, and is wrongly deduced from the premises.
As to the direct proofs, they are reduced to essays of interpretation,
either of inscriptions called Iberian or Keltiberian, or of numismatic
legends, or of proper, and especially of topographical names.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6706src" href="#xd26e6706" name="xd26e6706src">5</a>
The inscriptions and legends are written in characters evidently of
Ph&oelig;nician origin, but their interpretation is anything but
certain. All the readings, all the translations into Basque, proposed
by MM. Boudard, Phillips, and others, are disputed by the linguists who
are now studying the Basque. The names collected from ancient authors
form a more solid basis; but the explanations proposed by W. von
Humboldt, and after him by many etymologists without method,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6709src" href="#xd26e6709" name="xd26e6709src">6</a>
are equally for the most part inadmissible. The Iberian theory is not
proved, though it is perfectly possible.</p>
<p>The Basques do not present, in an anthropological point of view, as
far as we know at present, any original and well-defined <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>characteristic other than their
language.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6716src" href="#xd26e6716" name=
"xd26e6716src">7</a> Nothing in their manners or customs is peculiar to
them. It is in vain that some writers have tried to discover the
strange custom of the &ldquo;couvade&rdquo; among them, a custom still
observed, it is said, by the natives of South America and in the plains
of Tartary. It consists in the husband, when his wife is confined,
going to bed with the new-born infant, and there he
&ldquo;couve,&rdquo; &ldquo;broods over it,&rdquo; so to say. No modern
or contemporaneous writer has found this custom among the Basques; and
as to historical testimony, it is reduced to a passage of
Strabo&mdash;which nothing proves to be applicable to the ancestors of
the present Basques&mdash;and to certain allusions in writers of the
last two centuries. These allusions always refer to the
B&eacute;arnais, the dialect whence the word &ldquo;couvade&rdquo; is
borrowed.</p>
<p>Prince L. L. Bonaparte has discovered that in the Basque dialect of
Roncal the moon is called &ldquo;Goicoa;&rdquo; Jaungoicoa is the word
for &ldquo;God&rdquo; in Basque, and would mean &ldquo;the Lord
Moon,&rdquo; or rather &ldquo;our Lord the Moon.&rdquo; He cites, with
reference to this, &ldquo;the worship of the moon by the ancient
Basques.&rdquo; The only evidence in favour of this worship is a
passage of Strabo (Lib. iii., iv. 16), where it is said that the
Keltiberians, and their neighbours to the north, honour a certain
anonymous God by dances before their doors at night during the full
moon. But it must be proved that the Keltiberians and their neighbours
to the north were Basques.</p>
<p>Another passage of Strabo has furnished arguments to the
&ldquo;Iberists.&rdquo; He says (Lib. iii., iv. 18) that among the
Cantabrians the daughters inherited, to the detriment of their
brothers. M. Eug&egrave;ne Cordier has endeavoured, after <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>Laferri&egrave;re (&ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Histoire du Droit Fran&ccedil;ais</span>&rdquo;), to establish
that this arrangement is the origin of the right of primogeniture
without distinction of sex, and which is found more or less in all the
&ldquo;coutumes&rdquo; of the Western Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es. He has
developed this theory in an interesting essay, &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Sur l&rsquo;Organisation de la Famille chez les
Basques</span>&rdquo; (Paris, 1869). But an able lawyer of Bayonne, M.
Jules Balasque, has shown in Vol. II. of his remarkable
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Etudes Historiques sur la Ville de
Bayonne</span>&rdquo; (Bayonne, 1862&ndash;75) that there is nothing
peculiar to the Basques in this fact; and we can only recognise in it,
as in the opposite custom of &ldquo;juveignerie&rdquo; in certain
northern &ldquo;coutumes,&rdquo; an application of a principle
essentially Keltic or Gallic for the preservation of the patrimony.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I beg my readers to excuse the brevity of the
preceding notes; but, pressed for time, and overwhelmed with a
multitude of occupations, it has not been possible for me to do more.
If I am still subject to the reproach which Boileau addresses to those
who, in striving to be concise, become obscure, I have at least
endeavoured to conform to the precept of the Tamul poet,
Tiruvalluva&mdash;&ldquo;To call him a man who lavishes useless words,
is to call a man empty straw&rdquo; (I. Book, xx. chap., 6th
stanza).</p>

<p class="first">Perhaps there is no people among whom versification is
so common, and among whom really high-class poetry is so rare, as among
the Basques. The faculty of rhyming and of improvisation in verse is
constantly to be met with. Not unusually a traveller in one of the
country <i lang="fr">diligences</i>, especially on a market-day, will
be annoyed by the persistent crooning of one of the company, like
Horace of old, more or less under the inspiration of Bacchus; and if he
enquire what the man is about, he will be told that he is reciting a
narrative in verse of all the events of the past day, mingled probably
with more or less sarcastic reflections on the present company, and
with especial emphasis on the stranger. At the yearly village <i lang=
"fr">f&ecirc;tes</i>, when the great match of <i lang="fr">Jeu de Paume
au Rebot</i> has been lost or won, prizes are sometimes given for
improvisation on themes suggested at the moment, and the rapidity of
the leading <i>improvisatori</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6765src"
href="#xd26e6765" name="xd26e6765src">1</a> is something marvellous.
Moreover, there are two species of native Drama. One, the Pastorale,
the more regular and important, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>is now confined to the
Vall&eacute;e of La Saison and the Souletin district. The other, the
Charivari, or Mascarade, more unfettered and impromptu, giving free
rein to the invention of the actors, is occasionally, but rarely, acted
in all districts of the Pays Basque.</p>
<p>The Pastorale, or Tragedy, is certainly a representative and
survival of the Medi&aelig;val Mystery, or Miracle Play; and in the
remoter districts is acted almost as seriously as is the Ammergau
Passion Play. It is an open-air performance, which unites in
interminable length, and in the same piece, tragedy and comedy, music,
dancing, and opera. Though undoubtedly the oldest form in which Basque
poetry of any kind is preserved, it can have no claim to be an
indigenous product. The subjects of the older Pastorales are drawn from
three sources&mdash;from the Bible; from the lives of the Saints, or
Hagiology; from the Chansons de Geste and Romances of Chivalry. None of
the extant Pastorales, even in their earliest form, would, we think, be
anterior to the thirteenth century. The anachronisms, the prejudices,
the colouring, the state of education evinced, are all those of the
date when the Chansons de Geste and the Legenda Aurea were the
favourite literature of high and low; the epoch at the close of which
flourished the brilliant petty courts of Gaston de Foix at Orthez, and
of the Black Prince at Bordeaux. The anachronisms make Charlemagne a
contemporary of the Crusaders; Mahomet is an idol, and in the shape of
a wooden puppet sits on a cross-bar over one of the stage-entrances,
where he is worshipped by all his followers as they pass in and out.
The make-up of the characters and the dresses are conventional. But
though we cannot assign any higher antiquity even to the original form
of any of the extant Pastorales&mdash;we say original form, because
they have been edited and re-edited generation after generation by
almost every prompter at each successive representation&mdash;yet
several of the accessories and part of the stage-business point to
possibly older traditions. The stage, at least in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>the
more inaccessible villages, where alone the Pastorales are now to be
seen in anything like their genuine form, may still be described as
&ldquo;<i lang="la">modicis pulpita tignis</i>.&rdquo; It is generally
constructed against a house in the &ldquo;<i>Place</i>&rdquo; of the
village, and is composed of boards resting on inverted barrels; one or
more sheets, suspended from cross-bars, hide the house walls, and form
the background; to this drapery bunches of flowers and flags are
affixed, and thus is formed the whole &ldquo;scenery&rdquo;; the rest
is open air and sky. Usually behind the sheet, though sometimes in
front on a chair, sits the prompter, or stage-director; at the corners
and sides of the stage are the stage-keepers, armed with muskets, which
are fired off at certain effective moments, and always at the end of a
fight. But there are four points in which a Pastorale <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e6789" title="Source: recals">recalls</span> more
ancient traditions: (1) The sexes are never mingled; the Pastorale
being played either entirely by men, or entirely by women.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6792src" href="#xd26e6792" name="xd26e6792src">2</a>
(2) The speech is always a kind of recitative or chant, varying in time
according to the step of the actors. (3) There is a true chorus. (4)
The feet and metre of the verse correspond to the step and march of the
actors, and to the dancing of the chorus.</p>
<p>Now, as to (1), the effect is not unpleasing; the boy-lady or the
boy-angel is often one of the most successful actors, and makes an
excellent substitute for the real lady. There is no coarseness in his
acting; on the contrary, there is a certain reserve of movement caused
by the unwonted dress, which looks like a pleasing modesty, and makes
the boy appear really lady-like. His get-up is generally
unexceptionable.</p>
<p>We have once only had an opportunity of seeing a girl&rsquo;s
Pastorale, &ldquo;Ste. Hel&egrave;ne,&rdquo; at Garindein, in April of
the present year, 1879. Unfortunately it was interrupted, almost as
soon as commenced, by violent rain. The costumes were very modest and
pretty. The heroines of the piece wore blue or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>scarlet-jackets, with long white skirts; the
lady-heroes had shorter skirts and white unmentionables. The Pastorale
of &ldquo;Ste. Hel&egrave;ne&rdquo; has nothing to do with the mother
of Constantine the Great, or with the Invention of the Cross. It is an
<i>olla podrida</i> of old legends. The opening scene is taken from
&ldquo;The King who wished to marry his own daughter&rdquo; (see above,
p. 165.) A King Antoina wishes to marry his daughter Hel&egrave;ne, and
for that purpose procures a dispensation from the Pope, who appears on
the scene, attended by an angel. Hel&egrave;ne, however, still refuses,
and escapes; she embarks for England, but the captain of the vessel
falls outrageously in love with her (<i>cf.</i> &ldquo;Juan
Dekos,&rdquo; p. 148). A shipwreck saves her from his persecutions; she
lands alone in England, is seen by Henry, King of England, who falls in
love with her and forthwith marries her, in spite of his mother&rsquo;s
objections. He is forced to go to the wars; Hel&egrave;ne gives birth
to twin boys, but the queen-mother changes the letter, and sends word
to the King that she is confined of two puppies (<i>cf.</i> &ldquo;The
singing tree, the bird which tells the truth, and the water that makes
young,&rdquo; p. 177). Ste. Hel&egrave;ne is condemned to death;
Clarice, her maid, offers to die in her stead, but both escape; the
boys, who were supposed to have been murdered, at last reappear, and
all ends happily as in the legends. The part of the
&ldquo;Satans&rdquo; was taken by three middle-aged men, in buff
breeches and white stockings, who danced very well. The preliminary
procession on horseback, and the opening scene on the stage, were
exceedingly pretty.</p>
<p>(2) The recitative is always accompanied by music; generally a
violin or two, a flute, the chirola, and the so-called Basque
tambourine, a species of six-stringed guitar, beaten by a short stick,
or plectrum. The tune is almost a monotone, but differs in time, being
faster or slower according to the action of the piece; with the
exception of those parts in which the chorus alone has possession of
the stage, when the <i>Saut Basque</i> or other lively dancing airs are
played. The strong, clear chant of the actor accompanying this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>music, which is never overpowering in its
loudness, is heard much better and to a greater distance in the open
air than any mere speaking would be; and, moreover, it prevents rant,
without altogether effacing vivacity. For (3) there is a singular idea
running through all these Basque Pastorales, according to which
sanctity and nobility of character are associated with calmness of
demeanour and tone, and villany and devilry of all kinds with
restlessness and excitement. The angels and saints, the archbishops and
bishops, move with folded hands and softly gliding steps; the heroes
walk majestically slow; the common soldiers are somewhat more animated
and careless in their gestures; the Saracens, the enemies, the
villains, rush wildly about; but the chorus, or &ldquo;Satans,&rdquo;
are ever in restless, aimless, agitated movement, except when engaged
in actual dancing. It is on these last, the chorus&mdash;of whom there
should be three, or two at least&mdash;that the great fatigue and
burden of the acting weighs. None but the most active and well-knit
lads can play the part, and even them it tries severely. This chorus is
invariably called &ldquo;Satans;&rdquo; their dress is always rigidly
the same, and a pretty one it is&mdash;red beret or cap, red open
jacket, white trousers with red stripes, red sashes, <i>spartingues</i>
(hempen sandals) bound with red ribands; and they carry a little wand
ornamented with red ribands and terminating in a three-forked hooked
prong.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6820src" href="#xd26e6820" name=
"xd26e6820src">3</a> Blue is the colour consecrated to the good and
virtuous; red to the enemy and the vicious, to the English, Saracens,
and &ldquo;Satans.&rdquo; The task of the &ldquo;Satans&rdquo; is not
only to take part among the actors, but the difficulty of their
utterance is much heightened by the compelled rapidity of their
movements, while at intervals, when the stage is empty of other actors,
they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>occupy the front corners of it, and dance the
wild <i>Saut Basque</i>, singing at the same time some reflections on,
or anticipations of, the action of the piece played, much like the
chorus of a Greek tragedy; but, in addition to this, there is generally
a comic interlude, more or less impromptu, and very slightly, if at
all, connected with the main piece, wherein the &ldquo;Satans&rdquo;
take the principal <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, together with the best comedian
of the other actors. This is done to relieve the tedium of the heavy
tragedy, and, oddly enough, is often spoken partly in Gascon or in
French, while only Basque is used in the Pastorale proper. (4) As will
be judged from the above remarks, there is, perhaps, no spectacle in
Europe from which the original relations of feet, line, pause, metre,
verse, strophe, antistrophe, and rhythm in music, dance, and poetry can
be better studied than at a Basque Pastorale. It will be seen there at
a glance how far these terms are from being mere metaphors.</p>
<p>Now, when we add that many of the actors in these Pastorales
cannot&mdash;scarcely any could before the present
generation&mdash;read or write; that the Pastorales extend from three
to seven thousand lines, distributed in ballad verses of four lines
each, the second and fourth rhyming; and that the representations last
from six to eight hours, our readers may imagine the amount of serious
preparation required where every sentence has to be learned by heart
from repetition of a reader or reciter. Consequently, to get up a
Pastorale, a whole winter is not too long. The task is generally
performed at home in the actor&rsquo;s family, or in a house where two
or three meet together for the study, if neighbours. We have seen some
pleasing instances of the pride the whole family take in the success of
the actor. Asking once a pretty boy where he could have learnt to play
his part of lady in so very ladylike a manner, he answered, &ldquo;From
my father and my mother in the winter.&rdquo; At another time we had as
companion in a long day&rsquo;s walk a man upwards of sixty, who had
been a &ldquo;Satan&rdquo; in his youth. He explained how very
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>trying it is both to dance well and to sing at
the same time so as to be clearly heard. His father had been a
&ldquo;Satan&rdquo; before him, and had trained him for the occasion,
and had made him eat two raw eggs before commencing. He spoke of the
joy of the whole family when his performance was successful, though he
lost his voice for several days afterwards. To show what his former
agility must have been, he cleared every fence and obstacle in our path
gallantly, despite his sixty years. These Pastorales are seldom, if
ever, acted as a money speculation, but during the acting of them one
or two young men, accompanied by a pretty girl, make the round of the
spectators, offering a glass of wine, in quasi-payment for which you
are expected to place a coin in the plate which the maiden carries. The
amount collected is seldom much beyond what is required for the
necessary expenses; more often it is below, but if anything remains it
is spent on a grand feast to all the actors. The number of Pastorales
in existence is variously stated at from seventy to two hundred. The
former number we believe to be the nearer to the fact. The names of
those best known are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Abraham is the model of a Christian, and Abraham and Pharaon both
address their followers as &ldquo;barons.&rdquo; Satan flatteringly
addresses the shepherds by the Spanish title &ldquo;Caballeros&rdquo;
when he wants to lead them into mischief. The actors are by no means so
numerous as the &ldquo;<i lang="fr">r&ocirc;les</i>&rdquo;; one takes
several successive parts, often without change of dress, a custom which
heightens not a little the difficulty of following an acted
Pastorale.</p>
<p>There is more dramatic unity in &ldquo;Abraham,&rdquo; and the main
plot is more skilfully conducted than might be expected from its title.
The key-note of the action is given at once when Satan and Bulgifer
appear on horseback in the &ldquo;Place&rdquo; in front of the stage,
and announce their project of &ldquo;tormenting Abraham,&rdquo; and of
&ldquo;weakening the Christian Faith.&rdquo; The plot then follows
pretty closely the Bible narrative. Only it is Satan and Bulgifer who
are the authors of all Abraham&rsquo;s misfortunes and vexations;
although the angels constantly appear to save him when matters are at
their worst. It is the &ldquo;Satans&rdquo; who inflame Pharaon in
Egypt with the report and sight of Sara&rsquo;s beauty; it is they who
stir up strife between Abraham&rsquo;s and Lot&rsquo;s herdsmen; they
are delighted with the wickedness of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>inhabitants of Sodom,
which they direct to suit their own purposes; they stir up war against
Abraham and Lot in the persons of the Turkish kings with Biblical
names. These at first conquer Lot, and one by one slay all his
partisans, including the good giants Chavoq and Chorre, whose corpses
are carried off by Satan to be feasted upon, with the licorish
exclamation: &ldquo;O what cutlets! what a fine leg!!&rdquo; Then they
tempt Agar, and make her quarrel with Sara. In the scene preceding the
destruction of Sodom, although the angels are present, the inhabitants
round Lot&rsquo;s door are blinded, not by them, but &ldquo;by some
magician.&rdquo; Lot&rsquo;s wife, Uxor, when to be changed into a
pillar of salt, ingeniously falls under the stage, and there the
transformation takes place unseen. When Isaac is born, he is forthwith
baptised. Agar and Ismael are driven into the desert, and are saved by
the angel Gabriel. The play then gradually works up to the climax, the
sacrifice of Isaac&mdash;the last and terrible temptation&mdash;in
which the &ldquo;Satans&rdquo; tempt the &ldquo;two Christians,&rdquo;
Abraham and Isaac, to unbelief and disobedience, and are foiled as
ever. After this, the action languishes, Abraham dies, and the
Pastorale comes to an end. All the actors appear on the stage and chant
the <i>De Profundis</i>, then the angels sing, and all unite in a
concluding chant. We give a few verses from the scene of the sacrifice
as a specimen of the whole:&mdash;</p>

<p>Abraham is in the act of sacrificing when the Angel Gabriel seizes
him from behind, and bids him not do it, &amp;c., &amp;c. Any foreigner
who, unless he has a most charming interpreter or interpretress, can
sit out a whole Pastorale would surely deserve the first prize in the
school of patience.</p>
<p>The other kind of dramatic performance is much more irregular, and
may assume various forms according to the circumstances which give
occasion to it. It may be only a wild kind of carnival procession, the
Mascarade, where each gesticulates as the character he represents; or a
<i>charivari</i> in honour (?) of a dotard&rsquo;s marriage, wherein
the advantages of celibacy over married life are sarcastically set
forth; or it may take the form of a really witty impromptu comedy
played on a tiny stage in honour of the marriage or the good fortune of
the most popular persons of the village. One of the first kind is
excellently described in Chaho&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Biarritz,
entre les Pyr&eacute;ne&eacute;s et l&rsquo;Oc&eacute;an</span>,&rdquo;
vol. ii. pp. 84&ndash;121, to which we refer the reader. One of the
last kind was acted at Louhossoa about 1866, on the double occasion of
some marriages, and of the return of some young men from South America.

<p class="first">If we except the Pastorales, the whole of Basque
poetry may be described as lyrical; either secular, as songs, or
religious, as hymns and no&euml;ls. There is no epic in
Basque,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7383src" href="#xd26e7383" name=
"xd26e7383src">7</a> and scarcely any narrative ballads; even those
chiefly are of uncertain date. A few sonnets exist, but they are almost
exclusively translations or imitations of French, Spanish, or classical
poems, and cannot be considered as genuine productions of the Basque
muse. Some of the religious poetry may be described as didactic, but
this again is mostly paraphrase or translation. All that is really
native is lyrical. But even in song the Basques show no remarkable
poetical merit. The extreme facility with which the language lends
itself to rhyming desinence has a most injurious effect upon
versification. There are not verses only, but whole poems, in which
each line terminates with the same desinence. Instead of striving after
that perfection of form which the change of a single word or even
letter would affect injuriously, the Basques are too often satisfied
with this mere rhyme. Their compositions, too, if published at all, are
usually printed only on single sheets of paper, easily dispersed and
soon lost. Hence the preservation of Basque poetry is entrusted mainly
to the memory, and thus it happens that one scarcely meets with two
copies of the same song exactly alike. If the memory fails, the missing
words and rhymes are so easily supplied by others that it is not worth
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>effort to <span class="corr" id="xd26e7388"
title="Source: recal">recall</span> the precise expression used. And so
it comes to pass that, while versification is very common among the
Basques, high-class poetry is extremely rare. They have no song writers
to compare with Burns or with B&eacute;ranger. And if it be alleged
that poets like these are rare, even among people far more numerous and
more cultivated, the Basques still fall short, when measured by a much
lower standard. They have no poets to rival the Gascon, Jasmin, or to
compare with the Proven&ccedil;al or the Catalan singers at the other
end of the Pyrenean chain. There is no modern Basque song which can be
placed by the side of &ldquo;Le Demiselle&rdquo; and others of the
Biarritz poet, Justin Larrebat; and among the older poets neither
Dechepare nor Oyhenart is equal to the B&eacute;arnais, Despourrins.
While the Jacobite songs of Scotland are among the finest productions
of her lyric muse, the Carlist songs, on the contrary, though telling
of an equally brave and romantic struggle, are one and all below
mediocrity. But, while fully admitting this, there is yet much that is
pleasing in Basque poetry. If it has no great merits, it is still free
from any very gross defects. It is always true and manly, and
completely free from affectation. It is seldom forced, and the singer
sings just because it pleases him to do so, not to satisfy a craving
vanity or to strain after the name and fame of a poet. The moral tone
is almost always good. If at times, as in the drinking songs, and in
some few of the amatory, the expression is free and outspoken, vice is
never glossed over or covered with a false sentimentality. The Basque
is never mawkish or equivocal&mdash;with him right is right, and wrong
is wrong, and Basque poetry leaves no unpleasant after-taste
behind.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7391src" href="#xd26e7391" name=

<p>The only peculiarity, in a poetical sense, is the extreme fondness
for, and frequent employment of, allegory. In the love songs the fair
one is constantly addressed under some allegorical disguise. It is a
star the lover admires, or it is the nightingale who bewails his sad
lot. The loved one is a flower, or a heifer, a dove or a quail, a
pomegranate or an apple, figures common to the poets of other
countries; but the Basques, even the rudest of them, never confuse
these metaphors, as more famous poets sometimes do&mdash;the allegory
is ever consistently maintained throughout. Even in prose they are
accustomed to this use of allegory, and catch up the slightest allusion
to it; but to others it often renders their poetry obscure, and very
difficult of successful translation. The stranger is in doubt whether a
given poem is really meant only for a description of the habits of the
nightingale, or whether the bird is a pseudonym for the poet or the
poet&rsquo;s mistress. Curiously enough, sometimes educated Basques
seem to have almost as much difficulty in seizing this allegory as have
foreigners. Thus, in a work now in course of publication,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7400src" href="#xd26e7400" name="xd26e7400src">9</a>
one of the most famous of these allegorical complaints is actually
taken for a poetical description of the nightingale itself.</p>
<p>The historical songs, like all other historical remains among the
Basques, are few and doubtful. There are two songs, however, for which
are claimed a greater historical importance and a higher antiquity than
any others can pretend to. These are the so-called &ldquo;Leloaren
Cantua&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Altabiskarco Cantua.&rdquo; Both these are
reputed by some writers to be almost contemporaneous with the events
which they relate. The first is said to be founded on the wars of the
Roman Emperor Augustus with the Cantabri; the second is an account of
the defeat of Charlemagne&rsquo;s rearguard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>at
Roncesvalles, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 778. The former may be some
three hundred years old, but the latter is certainly a production of
the nineteenth century, though none the less it is the most spirited
offspring of the Basque muse. We will give the text and translation of
each, and then justify our conclusions.</p>

<p>The history of the above song is as follows: At the close of the
sixteenth century a notary of Zornoza, J. I&ntilde;iguez de
Ibarg&uuml;en, was commissioned by the Junta of Biscay to search the
principal libraries of Spain for documents relating to the Basques. In
the archives of Simancas he discovered an ancient MS. on parchment,
containing verses in Basque, some almost, others wholly obliterated. Of
these he copied what he could, and inserted them in p. 71 of his
&ldquo;<span lang="es">Cronica general de Espa&ntilde;a y sumaria de
Vizcaya</span>,&rdquo; a work which still exists in manuscript in the
town of Marquina. From this history of Ibarg&uuml;en the song was first
reproduced by the celebrated Wilhelm von Humboldt, and published by him
in 1817 in a supplement to Vater&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mithridates.&rdquo; The
text above given is taken from that of the &ldquo;Cancionero
Vasco,&rdquo; Series 2, iii., pp. 18, 20, and claims to be a new and
literal copy from the MS. &ldquo;Cronica&rdquo; of Ibarg&uuml;en. From
the date of its publication by Humboldt, this piece has been the
subject of much discussion. That it is one of the oldest fragments of
Basque poetry hardly admits of doubt. But, when asked to believe that
it is contemporary with Augustus, we must hesitate. The question
arises: Did Ibarg&uuml;en copy the almost defaced original exactly as
it was, or did he suffer his declared predilections unconsciously to
influence his reading of it?<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7791src" href=
"#xd26e7791" name="xd26e7791src">11</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>Many of the words are
still very obscure, and the translation of them is almost guess work.
The first verse has little or no apparent connection with the rest of
the poem, and has given rise to the most fanciful interpretations. Lelo
has been imagined by some to be the name of a Basque hero; Zara, or
Zarat, who kills him, the name of another; and the two reproduce the
story of Agamemnon and &AElig;gisthus. Others, with more probability,
take Lelo, as is certainly the case in other poems, for a mere refrain
(the everlasting Lelo, as a Basque proverb has it) used by the singer
merely to give the key to the tune or rhythm to which he modulates the
rest. Chaho, with his usual audacity, would translate it
&ldquo;glory,&rdquo; and render it thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Finished is the glory! dead is the glory,</p>
<p class="line xd26e7805">Our glory!</p>
<p class="line">Old age has killed the glory,</p>
<p class="line xd26e7805">Our glory!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But it has been very plausibly suggested<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7813src" href="#xd26e7813" name=
"xd26e7813src">12</a> that the verse bears a suspicious likeness to a
vague reminiscence of the Moslem cry &ldquo;L&acirc; &Ecirc;lah
Ul&acirc; Allah!&rdquo; &amp;c.; and if so, this, in the north of
Spain, would at one bound place the poem some eight centuries at least
after the time of Augustus. The proper names have a too correct look.
Octabiano, Roma, and Tiber are far too much like the Latin; for if
Greeks and Romans complained, as do Strabo and Mela, of the difficulty
of transcribing Basque or Iberian names into their own language, the
Basques might possibly find a somewhat corresponding difficulty in
transcribing Greek and Latin names into Basque. Moreover, in a later
verse appears &ldquo;Uchin,&rdquo; a <i>sobriquet</i> for
&ldquo;Augustino,&rdquo; as a baptismal name in use among the Spanish
Basques to this day. What the poem really refers to we dare not assert.
We present the &ldquo;Leloaren Cantua&rdquo; to our readers simply as
one of the oldest curiosities of Basque <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>The history of this song is very curious, and shows the little value
of subjective criticism in any but the most competent hands. The MS. of
it is alleged to have been found on the 5th of August, 1794, in a
convent at Fuenterrabia, by La Tour d&rsquo;Auvergne, the celebrated
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">premier grenadier</span>&rdquo; of the French
Army. It was printed about the year 1835, by Monglave, and accepted as
a genuine contemporary document by Fauriel, Chaho, Cenac-Moncaut, and
many other French writers; by Lafuente, Amador de los Rios, and other
Spanish authors; by Araquistain, and by the Editors of the
&ldquo;Revista Euskara&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;Cancionero Vasco&rdquo;
among the Basques. It is needless to say that all guide-books, tourist
sketches, <i lang="la">et hoc genus omne</i>, have adopted it. It was
inserted as genuine by Fr. Michel, in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, in 1858, and in more recent years a translation appeared
in another London magazine. In the &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Basques et
Navarrais</span>&rdquo; of M. Louis Lande, lately published, it is
alluded to as genuine; and the <i>Saturday Review</i> of the 17th of
August, 1878, quotes it as a corroboration of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Chanson de
Roland</span>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8122src" href=
"#xd26e8122" name="xd26e8122src">16</a> There have been some, however,
who have stoutly opposed these claims; among them M. Barry, of
Toulouse, M. Gaston Paris, and M. J. F. Blade, which last writer, both
in a separate pamphlet and in his &ldquo;<span lang="fr">&Eacute;tudes
sur l&rsquo;Origine des Basques</span>&rdquo; (Paris, 1859), has shown
from internal grounds its want of authenticity. M. Alexandre Dihinx, a
Basque, in a series of articles in the <i lang="fr">Impartial</i>, of
Bayonne, for 1873, which have since been reprinted by M. J. Vinson, in
<i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Avenir</i>, of Bayonne, May of the present year,
conclusively proved both the incorrectness and the modern character of
its Basque. But all these authors seem either to have been unaware of,
or to have unaccountably overlooked, the true history of the piece.
When M. Fr. Michel published this, and another song called
&ldquo;<span lang="eu">Abarcaren Cantua</span>,&rdquo; in the
<i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, in 1858, as specimens of
<i>ancient</i> Basque poetry, a letter from M. Antoine d&rsquo;Abbadie,
<span lang="fr">Membre de l&rsquo;Institut</span>, appeared forthwith
in the number for March, 1859, stating that the Abarca song had
actually been among the unsuccessful pieces submitted for the prize in
the poetical competition at Urrugne, of the previous August; and he
adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I am sorry that the <i lang="eu">Altabiscarraco
cantua</i>, mentioned in your same number, is acknowledged as a gem of
<i>ancient</i> popular poetry. Truth compels me to deny that it is
universally admitted as such, for one of my Basque neighbours has often
named the person who, about twenty four years ago, composed it in
French, and the other person, who translated it into <i>modern</i> but
indifferent Basque.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8159src" href=
"#xd26e8159" name="xd26e8159src">17</a> The latter idiom, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>on
purely philological ground, stands peerless among the most ancient
languages in Europe, and I have felt it my duty to disclaim unfounded
pretensions of which it has no need.&mdash;I am, etc.,</p>
<p class="signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Antoine
d&rsquo;Abbadie</span>,</p>
<p class="dateline">&ldquo;<i>London, Jan. 31, 1859.</i>&rdquo;<br>
<i lang="fr">Correspond. de l&rsquo;Institut de France.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next number M. Fr. Michel writes, &ldquo;henceforth I will
believe that the songs called <i lang="eu">Abarcaren Cantua</i> and
<i lang="eu">Altabiscarraco Cantua</i> are forgeries&rdquo;; this
testimony is decisive. It has often been repeated by M.
d&rsquo;Abbadie, with the additional assurance that he knows not only
the house, but the very room in which the song was first composed. That
the language is modern and indifferent Basque is very evident in the
text given by M. Fr. Michel in &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Le Pays Basque,
Paris, 1857.</span>&rdquo; That above, taken from the
&ldquo;<span lang="eu">Cancionero Vasco</span>&rdquo; of the present
year, is considerably corrected and improved. All attempts, and many
efforts have been made, to force these irregular lines into any known
form of Basque rhythm have hitherto signally failed. For the amusement
of some of our readers we give below a list of the more evident foreign
words in this and in the &ldquo;<span lang="eu">Leloaren
Cantua</span>.&rdquo; The relative antiquity will thus be seen at a

<p>With reference to the above list we may observe that the Basque
never begins a word with r, but always prefixes a euphonic er, ar, ir;
hence er-respuesta, ar-roca, Er-rolan, er-rege, hir-risko, risque, F.
In later copies editors have altered &ldquo;Romaco,&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Song of Lelo,&rdquo; into &ldquo;Er-romaco,&rdquo; to give it
more of a Basque look. Aren, or aen, eco-aco-co are case terminations;
tcea-cea marks the verbal noun. Carlomann was never the name of
Charlemagne, but of his brother and his uncle. Er-rolan is evidently
from the French Roland; neither from the Hruotlandus of Einhardus, nor
from the Spanish Roldan. Defenders of the authenticity of the piece
allege that these words are only corruptions, introduced in the course
of ages; but our readers can judge for themselves how far they enter
into the very structure of the composition.</p>
<p>The first book printed in Basque, the <span lang=
"la">&ldquo;Lingu&aelig; Vasconum Primiti&aelig;, per Dominum Bernardum
Echepare&rdquo;</span> (Bordeaux, 1545), is a collection of his poems,
religious and amatory, the latter predominating. Echepare was the
parish priest of the pretty little village of St. Michel, on the
B&eacute;h&eacute;robie Nive, above St. Jean Pied de Port; and, if
Nature alone could inspire a poet, he ought at least to have rivalled
those of our own English Lakes. But, in truth, his verses are of scant
poetical merit, and of little interest save as a philological
curiosity.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8535src" href="#xd26e8535" name=
"xd26e8535src">19</a> They belong so distinctly to that irritating
mediocrity which never can be excused in a poet. After Echepare the
next author is Arnauld Oyhenart, of Maul&eacute;on, who published a
collection of his youthful Basque poems in Paris, 1657. These have, if
anything, less poetical value than Echepare&rsquo;s; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>Oyhenart&rsquo;s collection of proverbs and his
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Notitia Utriusque Vasconi&aelig;</span>&rdquo;
will always make his name stand high among Basque writers. Except hymns
and no&euml;ls (Christmas carols), of which many collections and
editions have been published from 1630 downwards, and some of which are
noteworthy on account of higher than mere poetical merit, the deep and
evidently genuine spirit of piety they evince,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8543src" href="#xd26e8543" name="xd26e8543src">20</a> little else
is preserved much older than the present century. One ballad indeed
there is, &ldquo;The Betrothed of Tardetz,&rdquo; which may be somewhat
older. No two versions of it are exactly alike, though the outline of
the story is always the same. The Lord of the Castle of Tardetz wishes
to give the elder of his two daughters in marriage to the King of
Hungary, or of Portugal, as some have it. But the lady&rsquo;s heart
has been already won by Sala, the son of the miller of Tardetz, and she
bitterly bewails being &ldquo;sold like a heifer.&rdquo; The bells
which ring for her wedding will soon toll for her funeral. The romance
in its present form is evidently incomplete, but apparently ended with
the corpse of the bride being brought back to her father&rsquo;s
castle.</p>
<p>Most of the Basque songs, except the drinking ones, are set, more or
less, in a minor key. The majority of the love songs would have been
described by our forefathers as &ldquo;complaints.&rdquo; One of the
prettiest, both in words and music, is the fragment entitled &ldquo;The
Hermitage of St. Joseph&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

the poverty of the one, or the transient gleams of good fortune of the
other. At least, such is the case in all those which are really songs
of the people. In these there are not many delights of &ldquo;life
under the greenwood tree,&rdquo; as in Robin Hood, or our factitious
gipsies&rsquo; songs. The forest is an object of dread to the Basque
poet, and it requires courage and all the powerful attraction of a
loved one to induce him to traverse by night its gloomy shades; but

<p>There are, too, verses of grim and bitter humour, which tell better
than the pen of the historian how wretched was formerly the lot of the
peasant, even in this favoured corner of France. Famine is personified,
and has a name given it, drawn in biting irony from that of the highest
Saint of the Church Calendar, Petiri Sanz (S. Peter). He wanders round
the country seeking where to settle permanently; at one place he is
driven off by (the sale of) rosin, at another <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>little maize, at another by cheese and cherries;
but at last he fixes his <span class="corr" id="xd26e8976" title=
"Source: aboded efinitively">abode definitively</span> at St.
P&eacute;e (another form of Peter), on the Nivelle, where they have
nothing at all to sell, and where he torments the inhabitants by
forcing them to keep many a fast beyond those of ecclesiastical
obligation. The same strain of gloomy humour appears in another form in
a poem entitled &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Mes
M&eacute;ditations</span>,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8982src"
href="#xd26e8982" name="xd26e8982src">24</a> in which a young priest of
Ciboure, slowly dying of consumption, traces in detail all the physical
and mental agonies of his approaching dissolution. A much less grim
example, however, is contained in the following, which we quote mainly
because of its brevity. It may remind some of our readers of a longer
but similar strain which used often to be sung at harvest-homes in the
Midland Counties:&mdash;</p>

<p>The lack of good poetry in Basque is certainly not due to want of
encouragement. Moreover, the wish to produce it is there, but the power
seems lacking. For over twenty years prizes have been annually given,
first at Urrugne, and then at Sare, by M. Antoine d&rsquo;Abbadie, of
Abbadia. But among the multitude of competing poems few have been of
any real value, and both in merit and in the number presented they seem
to diminish annually. The best of them have been written by men of the
professional class, whose taste has been formed on French, or Spanish,
or classical, rather than on native models. The following is considered
by native critics to be among the best, though several others are very
little, if at all, inferior<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9099src" href=

<p>The best living Basque poets are&mdash;on the French side, Captain
Elisamboure, of Hendaye; and Iparraguirre, of San Sebastian, among the
Spanish Basques. Iparraguirre is now very old. He is the author of the
song &ldquo;<span lang="es">Guernicaco Arbola</span>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The
Tree of Guernica,&rdquo; in Biscay), an oak under which the Lords of
Biscay swore fidelity to the Fueros. This has become almost the
national song of the Basques.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9776src" href=
"#xd26e9776" name="xd26e9776src">29</a> A few words on two other
classes of songs, the drinking and the <i>macaronic</i>, must conclude
our remarks. The most spirited drinking song is the following.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9784src" href="#xd26e9784" name=
"xd26e9784src">30</a> It must be remembered, in excuse, that the
shepherds live a very hard life on the mountains the greater part of
the year, and taste little wine there.</p>

<p>It is not at all uncommon in a country where, within the space of
some twenty miles, the traveller may hear at least four
languages&mdash;French, Gascoun, Basque, and Spanish&mdash;to find two
or more of these mixed in the same poem, and sometimes with a little
Latin as well. This occurs frequently in the no&euml;ls, where the
angel speaks in French or Latin, and the shepherds reply in Gascoun or
Basque; also sometimes in the love songs, where the French or Spanish
lover will try to soften the heart of a Basque maiden by compliments in
French or Spanish, while she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=

song given in Fr. Michel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Le Pays Basque,&rdquo; p. 429.

<p>Almost every one of these Basque songs, like all true lyrics, has
been adapted to some tune, either older than the words, or composed
specially by the author. The music is often superior to the words. In
the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> for August, 1878, Grant-Duff speaks of
some of the Basque airs sung by the B&eacute;arnais tenor, Pascal
Lamazou, as &ldquo;extraordinarily beautiful.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e10230src" href="#xd26e10230" name="xd26e10230src">31</a>
Lamazou died at Pau in May, 1878. His <i lang=
"fr">r&eacute;pertoire</i> consisted of fifty Pyrenean songs, of which
thirty-four are B&eacute;arnais, fourteen Basque, and two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>are
from the &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es
Orientales</span>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10242src" href=
"#xd26e10242" name="xd26e10242src">32</a> One of the Basque airs
&ldquo;Artzaina,&rdquo; has somehow got attached to the popular
American hymn, &ldquo;I want to be an angel.&rdquo; Another, and larger
collection, including more correct renderings of some of
Lamazou&rsquo;s fourteen, is that of Sallaberry, &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Chants Populaires du Pays Basque</span>&rdquo; (Bayonne, 1870).
But, long before this, a collection of Basque Songs, Zorzicos, and
dance music was published in San Sebastian, by J. D. Iztueta, in 1824
and 1826. Excellent reviews of these two works, with translations of
some of the words, appeared in the <i>Foreign Review and Continental
Miscellany</i>, vol. ii., pp. 338, 1828; and in vol. iv., p. 198. Some
specimens of music are to be found at the end of Michel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Le Pays Basque</span>,&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Cancionero Vasco&rdquo;&mdash;now in course of publication, and
so often referred to&mdash;and in other local publications, besides
those in private hands. Basquophiles love to narrate that Rossini
passed a summer in the Basque village of Cambo, and believe that they
can recognise the influence of Basque airs in some of his subsequent
operas. However this may be, let no one judge of Basque music by the
no&euml;ls usually howled in the streets at Christmas and the New Year,
or by the doleful productions of the last Carlist War. It would be
equally fair to judge of English music by the serenades of the waits at
Christmas. We refer those who wish to investigate further the subject
of this chapter to the excellent work, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Le Pays
Basque</span>,&rdquo; par M. Fr. Michel (Paris and London, 1857), for
the French, to the &ldquo;Cancionero Vasco,&rdquo; by Don Jos&eacute;
Manterola, now in course of publication at San Sebastian, for the
Spanish, Basque; and to M. Sallaberry&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span lang=

that there is really no authority for treating these words as proper

&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Les &Eacute;chos du Pas de Roland</span>,&rdquo;
par J. B. Dasconaguerre, Bayonne, 1868, professes on the title to be
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">traduit du Basque</span>&rdquo;; but the
&ldquo;<span lang="eu">Atheko-gaitzeko Oiharzunak</span>&rdquo; (the
echoes of the bad door or pass), Bayonan, 1870, is really a translation
from the <i>French</i>. To the Basques the name of Roland is unknown in
connection with this beautiful ravine. M. Fr. Michel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Le Romancero du Pays Basque</span>,&rdquo;
Didot, Paris, 1859, is scarcely less an embroidery on themes of which
the ground only is Basque.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=
