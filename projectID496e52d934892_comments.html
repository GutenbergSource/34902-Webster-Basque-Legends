More folk-lore, this time of the Basque people, whose homeland is partly in Northern Spain, and partly in Southwestern France.

<p>I expect no particular problems proofing this work. At the end of the volume a few poems in the Basque language appear, and a few pages have been cut very close to the edge of the text, chopping of the last half of the letter, but everything should be reconstructable.
